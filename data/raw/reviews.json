This can lead to a very frustrating experience. This is made worse with lack of map knowledge, requiring a lot of trial & error (without guidance) till you successfully figure out higher success rate pixel peeks, and seemingly repeat the same scenario again & again. \r\n\r\nIt's nice to play with friends, but the unforgiving nature of the game, means you're probably better playing Deathmatch mode than even Casual mode. Any frustrating map elements (maps aren't like the CS 1.6 or Source days), that much more experienced players know how to utilise, will only compound any pre-existing frustrations.",

Now, I mean today (23rd of August 2024), I've decided to try this \"CS2\" game, just to remind myself of old good times.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, everything's changed. It's hard to get used to something, which is completely different from what you remember. What I mean by that is they've changed some maps (didn't check them all out), the menu of the game looks terrible in my opinion, the store in the game looks different. Personally I prefer old design.\r\nSecond - my laptop is weak and even if I wanted to, I wouldn't be able to play this game even with 1280x720 resolution. I understand that progress doesn't stop, graphically all games become better, technologies are going ahead. But it's sad that the developers don't think about such players/users as I am who can't afford to have a better machine to run the game.\r\nThird - the achievements. Where are they? I enjoyed playing the game to get new achievements, it was fun and motivational. \r\nI don't know about the cheaters/hackers problem, didn't encounter them but I see that people are complaining about them in the reviews.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I'd like to say that the developers (Valve) ruined their own product. What they value is not the quality but money ( from tournaments, community market, gambling with skins) and it's disappointing.",

I used to love this game from when there are not many fancy things involved. Then came CS GO. This was a major update and the online community has gone big with the update. Again a major hit when doing lan parties or having fun in lobbies with friends. But the era of encountering cheaters in game has started with this update. But we never gave this issue a lot of thought as we used to have fun in closed servers and still be able to gain XP in decent matches when the cheaters are not around.\nNow came CS2 which was abruptly pushed into our lives and made it absurd with performance issues and bad servers at start and then the cheaters came along and ruined the fun even more. Icing on the cake is the removal of closed matchmaking. We no longer have a official way to create private servers and have fun with friends over internet. I know a lot of people may argue we still can play private servers, Trust me We are trying to host a decent server over internet to play along with my closest friends and that has been a disaster so far. \nAgain I love counter strike and I always had a soft spot for this game. But the servers, bad matchmaking with over powered opponents and ranking system is so frustrating. This combined with bad teammates who doesn't even radio properly is like jumping off the cliff. Recently Valve decided that we cannot gain XP when playing Competitive with friends. I don't know who's genies idea is this. But Valve, This is the worst possible decision you can take in recent times.\nThe Issue with Cheaters is so bad we almost all the time gets at least one wall hacker or an aim-bot user in every match. Out of 100 matches we get these players in at least 70 matches. They were reported and still running in game and we even got messages that acknowledge them cheating and still we couldn't manage to eliminate them from server. For a game that is generating a lot of player traffic and trade. This is a major issue that kills the fun of the game.\nI used to ask any new player I met to come and play CS before CS2 and now I'm asking to not go into CS2 unless they need to be abused and ridiculed by toxic players and cheaters.",

        "review": "I still play the game often and I like it, but I leave a negative review because I don't like the direction it's taken. I want CS to become better, I love playing it with my friends, I like the skins, and the community has brought me many laughs, but it feels like Valve is putting the bare minimum effort to keep the game alive and have people spend money. Here's why:\n\n-Game released bare-bones missing many maps and game modes from CSGO\n\n-To date, every new update makes it run worse, the latest update has issues with huge frame drops, stutters, and freezing. Frame in CSGO was consistent 400, now I'm lucky to get 160fps with half decent frame times.\n\n-Community servers are a shambling corpse of what it was in CSGO. That side of the community is dead. All the servers are full of bots. No good AWP only servers, a few good 1v1 servers, no zombies, no deathrun or the other dozens of other fun game mode servers. That whole creative side of the community has been abandoned by Valve and given little support. Surf zoomer are eating well, at least. \n\n-Maps are pretty BUT the amount of visual clutter only lowers frames and makes it harder to see enemies.\n\n-Ruined factory new skins by giving them all wear. Now a factory new skin looks like a minimal wear or even field tested from CSGO. Example, Bizon Osiris. (thanks for making those skins slightly cheaper, at least)\n\n-Player models are not accurate to hit boxes, the default CT is terrible. I've flicked to parts of the model that don't count as a hit. That is a terrible decision for a competitive game.\n\n-No more default player models that vary depending on the map. Not a big loss, but it shows a lack of attention imo.\n\n-The HUD keeps getting worse. It's amazing how badly they can mess this up. CSGO had a minimalist, clean, and easy to read HUD with all the important info in places that have a physical reference point irl, like the health at the bottom left. New CS2 HUD has transparency on everything, selected items don't highlight as well, I really miss the nice touch of my weapons being highlighted in the color of their rarity, mini map is harder to read, my money is bigger than my health or armor, and I don't need to know what team I am by having a big emblem in the middle of my screen. The HUD is provably and quantifiably worse than in CSGO.\n\n-Why do we have first shot inaccuracy?? Why? Makes zero sense in this type of competitive game. Why do I need to miss my one-tap headshot when my aim is on the enemy's head? Is the game really better for having that?\n\n-Hacker issue still not fix, and the hacks have only gotten more powerful. We are talking Rainbow Six Siege levels of absurd hacks. They can change the spread of shotguns and change the the fire rate, absurd things like that.\n\n-Ranks and elo systems are terrible and matchmaking will put you in games that will force you to lose. I'm talking about putting you against teams with 5k more elo than anyone on your team.\n\n-Still no overwatch system like in CSGO.\n\n-The biggest updates we got until now is a few community maps and the ability to switch hand view model... SIX months in. You know the community is starving for content when that is considered a huge update. In CSGO that would be a normal bi-monthly update.\n\n-Hit reg is terrible and it's probably sub-tick being terrible. \n\n-AWP nerfs were not needed and makes it frustrating to use. Inaccuracy when getting hit is terrible and taking longer for the scope to settle after aiming makes getting quick kills a game of luck at times. The AWP was fine in CSGO, maybe even perfect and satisfying to use, CS2 doesn't feel the same. I can't say it's worse, but It doesn't feel like CS anymore.\n\n-Run and gun meta has only gotten worse.\n\n-the tracers lie and your spray control would do better without it.\n\n-Casual is now even worse to play because of terrible frame rate and frame timing.\n\n-Game is trying way too hard to \"modernize\" and feel like the other zoomer competitive games like Valorant. Know what you are and own it. I don't want a cluttered HUD or an mvp animations, and please never add keychains.\n\n+ Grenade line up reticent is an great change.\n+Most skins look amazing\n+maps are nice look great, even if they run terrible.\n+Follow recoil is kinda cool, works wonder on the Negev.\n~Da Dust2 box",

        "review": "I\u2019ve been a fan of the Counter-Strike series for years, but Counter-Strike 2 has left me underwhelmed. The biggest issue is the lack of significant new content. The remastered maps look prettier, but that\u2019s about it. No new maps to speak of, which is a major letdown. The community is divided on the new subtick system, and I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s an improvement. It\u2019s too complicated and feels like a gimmick.\n\nThe removal of features from CS:GO is also a blow. The buy wheel was a simple, intuitive system that\u2019s been replaced with a grid that\u2019s busier and more confusing. And don\u2019t even get me started on the VAC system, which seems to be ineffective against cheaters. The rank system is also broken, with inconsistent progression and frustrating setbacks.\n\nA Step Backwards\n\nCounter-Strike 2 feels like a step back from its predecessor. The graphics are nice, but the gameplay has taken a hit. The game\u2019s difficulty is off the charts, making it hard for new players to get on board. Even experienced players like myself are struggling to adjust. The lack of innovation and the removal of beloved features make it hard to recommend Counter-Strike 2 over CS:GO.\n\nFree, But Not Worth It\n\nThe game\u2019s free upgrade is nice, but it\u2019s not enough to make up for the lack of substance. MW2019, another tactical shooter, is a better option in my opinion. Counter-Strike 2\u2019s poor design choices and lack of new content make it a disappointing experience. Until Valve addresses these issues and adds meaningful updates, I\u2019ll be sticking with CS:GO or exploring other options.",

While it isn't a ton of blatant cheating, almost every match has at least one stealthy waller if you run back and watch the match over.\n\nd) Firing weapons still feels off. You adapt to it, but its still jank. It is likely due to the \"sub-tick\" system being inferior to even 64tick servers from GO.\n\ne) Network issues are still a huge issue, and you'll find yourself dying behind walls 1 or 2sec after an enemy encounter, or rubber-banding all over the place.\n\nf) gamemodes are not in the game at all after one year\n\ng) There is a massive bug where the game is incompatible with discord and will crash mid game, or mid round.\n\nh) Its lower on my list, but an operation would be nice. \n\ni) General laziness and sloppiness from devs, like lack of different stock playermodels that are specific to map.\n\nOverall, the game has not been cared for as much as it should have. I hope to see changes going forward, but just general tweaking of maps is not enough to fix this game. It needs some very serious work before it is going to get me to change my review around.",

From the handling of the weapons, to peeking mechanics, the scopes, etc, everything feels super responsive and crunchy. That being said, I cannot actually recommend this game due to the players. If you do too well, you will be branded a cheater and kicked from games, by people who will call you every type of slur under the sun. There are constant bots that join and fill up lobbies spouting off random sermon nonsense just to annoy and take away slots for matchmaking about whatever team they are on. About 50% of the people who type in text chat are toxic and genuinely hateful people, as I said earlier, calling anyone any kind of slur you can think of. After 400 hours of me genuinely \"getting good\" at this game, I have to drop it, as I can't deal with these awful people who play this game anymore. Even call of duty is a much better experience in this department.",

The lag-tagging is insane, you can be 5 meters passed a corner, already heading to another fight, and someone can tag you once and you seemingly get teleported back to fight them. First shot accuracy is a joke spat in the face of the players. Valve seriously needs to fix the inherent bugs in their server code and sub-tick system before CS2 will even hold a candle in the room of CS1.6 or GO.

At random intervals, it will suddenly not be VAC authenticated and you have to verify files even if you were literally just in a match. and the worst part is valve is to busy adding other unneeded features and mechanics to fix the game.

It\u2019s incredibly frustrating, especially when you encounter cheaters three games in a row using aim bots.

With that being said, it's very unfortunate that the situation with hackers at the moment has never improved. While Valve claims to be doing things behind the scenes, improvements have been so so agonizingly slow. Never regulated, absolutely a waste of my time at this point and it's so sad. This game has gone down the drain and I want to say things so much more vial. But I hope the point comes across. I play this game with a passion and with friends, but this is so ridiculous that this company even thinks they're serving some sort of community.",

Sure it looks nice it sounds nice and it's always awesome when you're doing well, but I shouldn't have to be the one to compensate for the game's terrible hit reg and accuracy. The amount of times I've seen several of my shots hit and the blood splatters be everywhere just for me to die and in the end round screen it say i only hit the enemy once....it's ridiculous. Rage inducing. This game is also full of hackers and wallers and basically what you'd expect from a free old game like this. Also damage from any weapon is inconsistent and unrealistic. I get it's a game, but before i played all I could hear from people is \"if you want a realistic FPS game play CS\" and man it's worse than COD which is really saying something. The recoil patterns are also unrealistc, but i think that can also be in the bad hit reg category. If you do play this game, play Arms Race (Gun Game) or custom maps if you can find people to join you. Otherwise, don't waste your time.\n\nPlease tell me how bad I am down below. I will absolutely ignore you because I don't care.",

        "review": "Yes I'm aware that my thumbs up is never going to be seen by anyone. There is literally thousands of them. \n\nBut what I'm NOT seeing is people actually talking about the game. At least at time of writing. Most people are talking about how good it looks, or how well it plays. Or vice versa. But no one talking about what the game is like. Or how it feels to play it. Is it worth my fricken money???\n\nWell let me help with that. Yes it's worth the money.\n\nIt's a souls-like game despite it not having that tag on the steam store page. It plays similar to Jedi Fallen Order or God of War or Darksiders. It's a linear action game where if you die you go back to a resting point. If you rest at said resting point all enemies respawn as does your healing items. However unlike Dark Souls or Elden Ring you don't lose experience points, money or items when you die.\n\nBut yes, the production value in this game is off the charts. It looks even more beautiful then it does on the steam store page. It sounds beautiful too. The gameplay is also fun, fluid and engaging. There's so much done right about this game that I hate to talk about whats wrong with it.\n\nFor instance the tutorial is severely lacking. Barely teaches you anything. \n\nOr how there's little to no direction in the game. Unless i'm severely missing something. But After the first hour I was absolutely, completely. 100 percent lost. No idea where to go or what to do. The game is lacking in direction in pretty much every single definition of the word and I actually hate that.\n\nBut if you can find your own way, don't mind really hard games and don't mind a character with no character or a plot with no plot then this game does everything else 110 percent perfect.\n\nSo let that be your deciding factor I guess. I mean 60 dollars is still a lot of money, just know what you're getting into. But if this genre is what you're looking for then it's worth the money.\n\nIf you'd like a more in-depth look at the game and what not feel free to check out my review on my YouTube Channel (link below).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd7FjFAk6Rg\n\nOtherwise, thanks so much for reading and I hope I managed to help some of you out there spend your money wisely.",

        "review": "[h1]Black Myth Wukong Review [/h1]\nI played 9 hours but 4 were offline so I think it will say I played 5 hours, I didn't beat the game, yet I still made this comprehensive review to explain the core aspects of the game and it's quality. This review uses my own experience and those of my friends who got ahead in the game. I am 30 years old, and I don't enjoy souls likes anymore in the long term. Still, I did my review objectively and I think you might find it useful. Cheers!~\n\nBlack Myth Wukong is a soul-like game that adds some interesting elements to the genre by incorporating new ideas into its gameplay through the legendary tale of Sun Wukong. Players can transform into bosses they defeated before (with some limitations), and Wukong's tricks are plenty. They can range from transforming into rock to making multiple clones of themselves or freezing foes in place, unable to move or fight back.\n\nThe player will explore the tale of the legendary monkey king while fighting challenging bosses and recovering the artifacts of Wukong. The game starts easy but rapidly reaches difficulty levels of your most popular soul games, requiring skill, strategy, and wits to defeat fearsome foes. \n\n[h1]What Makes It Worth Playing?[/h1]\nIf there is something people hear about this game, it is two things: transforming into bosses and ray tracing. The ray tracing of the game looks beautiful, as reflections and environments look superb on the screen. The requirements are quite bulky, as I used an RTX 4070 Super and could either go 2k with Ray Tracing at medium with settings on very high for 70-90 FPS or 4k with no ray tracing at the same frame rate.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3313363373\n\nThe story is surprisingly very good and interesting, voice actors do well in their assigned roles, and the opening of the game is similar to a blockbuster movie. The tale deals with wanting to be free, which Wukong wants, but the Celestial Court won't let him be. In addition, the court enjoys mocking him and other beast-like creatures, angering him as he rebels to prove his might. The difficulty is another aspect that might attract players looking to establish themselves and face off against challenging foes in exciting and nerve-wracking gameplay.\n\n\n\n[h1]Core Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game's core combat focuses on options and the availability of resources. The player has multiple avenues for choosing how to fight enemies, such as spirits that they can summon and take their form to unleash special attacks, becoming bosses, using skills such as invisibility, or using their pole to get above the enemy and avoid attacks. Having so many assets to use on foes and see what works best against certain enemies is incredibly fun and rewarding.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3313362079\n\nThe premise is that the game is a boss rush; you go to a place, explore it, beat the boss, and move on. If you defeat bosses effortlessly, you run into a lot of bosses on the norm, and each combat is intriguing and unique. Battle monks that summon the fallen, rat siblings in a 1vs2, giant tigers that bathe in the blood of their foes with big swords, etc. The game action is fast, so you have to act quickly before enemies resume the onslaught of attacks. There is no co-op for this game (so those that like souls games with co-op experiences, be warned, it is only going to be you!), and there is no punishment for dying in-game, so you are stress-free and don't have to pick up your \"souls\" or currencies of other types.\n\n\n[h1]My Experience[/h1]\nI enjoyed my time in the game, as brief as it was (I am getting old to be playing this hardcore game, I swear, haha~). I didn't find the stances attractive, as the default stance worked better for me than the other two. The tricks of Wukong are fun to use, and in boss fights, you need to use all of your arsenals intelligently to emerge victorious on the challenging boss fights, which is a great gameplay design. Enemies often have their particular bag of tricks they will use on the player.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3313363052\n\nI used many points in the foundation, mainly HP and stamina. I also used some points in transformations and the immobility spell, as they are instrumental. The gameplay is like a combination of souls, like in action games. It is hard, but you are as powerful as your foes, making the soul-like experience less stressful and difficult. The game's presentation is fantastic; enemies react to your boss's transformations, and the dialogue in fights is on par with the rest of the game. \n\n[h1]Long Term Appeal [/h1]\nA game playthrough will last between 40-60 hours, depending on your skill, and you can always replay the game after beating it to challenge even stronger foes. I am getting burned out of the genre. Go there, fight a powerful enemy, get destroyed, do it again until you succeed, and repeat for another 40 hours. I may have been playing too much Elden Ring, but I don't enjoy Souls games as much as I did before.\n\nBack to the review, if you like challenges meant to block your progression and prove your skills, this game is impressive. It excels at all its facets and is incredible to experience. If you prefer to avoid difficulty, be wary. It is a marathon to get to the end of this title, as the mountain is rather tall and complex to climb.\n\n[h1] Price Point Analysis[/h1]\nIt is an easy buy for its asking price. If your computer can run it, you are guaranteed to have a good time with this game.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIn a genre so cluttered with so many games that it feels oversaturated, Black Myth Wukong succeeds in adding a new spice to the genre by revolutionizing the gameplay and rewards of its core experience. It is a must-play for all souls, like fans who enjoy this title, and an invitation to try it out for those who feel braver and confident in their skills. This game's graphics, music, story, gameplay, and design are superb and worth all the praise it's been getting.\n\n10/10 MASTERPIECE\n\n\n:) If you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator!

        "review": "Black Myth: Wukong is a game I've eagerly anticipated for what feels like an eternity, and it doesn't disappoint. This title perfectly captures the essence of a classic hack and slash experience, evoking memories of the golden PS3 era. The gameplay is smooth, satisfying, and relentless, offering the kind of visceral combat that fans of the genre will instantly fall in love with.\n\nWhat makes Black Myth: Wukong stand out even more is its scale. The game doesn't just pit you against a handful of enemies; it throws you into epic, sprawling battles that feel monumental. The sense of grandeur in each fight, the vast environments, and the formidable foes all contribute to a game that feels as massive as the legend it\u2019s based on.\n\nSpeaking of legends, the story is rooted in the already incredible tale of the Monkey King, one of the most beloved characters in Chinese folklore. The narrative pulls you in, blending myth with a dark, fantastical world that is both enchanting and terrifying. Black Myth: Wukong doesn't just tell the story; it makes you live it, putting you in the shoes or rather, the fur of one of the most iconic characters in mythology.\n\nHowever, it's frustrating to see the double standards in the industry when it comes to discussing diversity and inclusion in video games. Screen Rant, for example, has been criticized for targeting only Asian games with accusations of lacking diversity titles like Stellar Blade, Genshin Impact, and now Black Myth: Wukong.\n\nAnd honestly, what kind of diversity are people expecting from a game about a stone monkey fighting demons? There are literally no humans in sight, not even Chinese characters, because the story is rooted in myth, not in modern social narratives. Yet somehow, some still find things to complain about, pushing Western agendas into places they simply don't belong.\n\nEdit: Wow the game reached 2.2 Million player, becoming one of the most played single player game ever. This is the result of making game for the sake of making game, instead of making a game for political agenda.",

        "review": "Amazing game in every aspect. Totally recommended it if you're into something similar to God of War (the new one) with some soulslike mechanics. Very fun to play, linear and semi-open world regions with lots of exploration, secrets, enemies and some remarkable bosses.\n\nAs far as performance goes, if you don't use Ray Tracing on Very High (or don't use it at all) and turn on upscaling, you'll be fine. Ray Tracing is quite demanding in some areas later in the game. Even with Frame Generation, it may not be enough depending on your GPU. \n\nAlso, yes, New Game+ unlocks after you finish the game. You get to keep everything you earned, except the items required to progress the story. Enemies also become stronger.\n\nSpecs:\nRyzen 5 7600\nRTX 4070\n2x16GB 5200MHz DDR5\nSSD Nvme Gen4\nWin 11\n\nPlayed most of the game at 1440p, 60 fps, Cinematic Settings, DLSS Balanced, FG ON, Ray Tracing Very High.\n\nDuring the last chapter I had to tune down Ray Tracing a bit to maintain an average of 60 fps. \n\nI had one crash. No blue screen or out of memory errors.",

BUT it has never intends to be yet it is still good enough to make your moeny worth spending. You dont need to be well aware of any Chinese old customs or traditional stories to play this game. Chinese people didn't stop playing Greek story game for lacking the background knowleage. The game speak for himself(or herself). And if you are really concerned about the political right kinda stuff apear in this game, it might disappoint you. It doesn't have black or white people,or lgbtq+ people, but for the very least, there ARE wolves and elephant and dogs and frog people in it so consider is DIVERSIFIED enough. Welcome to play this game and learn more about Wukong.",

        "review": "A very ambitious, refreshing, action-RPG that focuses on cinematic action and hyper dynamic combat while doing away with the usual open world fluff that has gotten way out of control since the mid 2010's.\n\nIts a little linear, almost in a dated / nostalgic but it really doesn't miss a beat thanks to stunning, epic cutscenes and frenetic, unique boss fights (don't call it a boss rush), constantly pushing the player forwards through the chapter and yearning for more.  \nSometimes a little too far ahead, to the detriment of the story while at other times offering up some incredible characters and lore along with touching moments... And lots of refreshing to do on Journey to the West and Chinese mythology.\nCombat is speedy and dynamic but quite precise and usually pretty clean / readable. \n\nA little technically unpolished on release with some noticeable bugs here and there and a somewhat uneven localisation (at least in English). \n\nIt's spent a long time cooking and ultimately feels like a great first step in Chinese AAA gaming.",

I think localised translations do present some problems, as many complex cultural backgrounds take a long time to research in order to make the most accurate translation.\nBut for all the overseas players, please trust me that a lot of the game's backstory is hard to understand even for me, such as some of the words carved on the stone monuments.\n\nIn addition, there is also something that game science, a game maker, likes to hide content, and many parts of the game content are scattered throughout the game, requiring players to constantly explore and dig into the details.\n\nFor a Chinese gamer like me, I finally don't have to go to the language settings to find the language option and change it to Simplified Chinese. Now I just need to keep the default settings.\n\nI hope this game can become a huge success and everyong can enjoy the game content while he is exploring the mysterious world of Journey to the West.\n\nIf you encounter some obscure content while playing, you can leave a comment. I will go to the Chinese search engine to see if I can find the answer (I am not sure I can solve your problem), but everyone can express their own opinions. I believe this is the joy of playing games together and understanding them.",

The localization of this game is also a challenge. As Chinese people, we are easy in understanding the dialogue and lines in the game, because the story of Journey to the West is well known to women and children, but for English players, some lines with a large number of religious, mythological and ancient Chinese (classical Chinese) elements will bring no small understanding challenges.\n\n\u53f2\u8bd7\u7ea7\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u4e1c\u65b9\u4f20\u5947\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5236\u4f5c\u7cbe\u826f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u8868\u6f14\u6548\u679c\u548c\u4e00\u6d41\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u548c\u97f3\u6548\u3002\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cc\u7a0b\u7891\u3002\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u4e9a\u6d32\u6587\u5316\u5708\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u60f3\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u719f\u6089\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6587\u5b66\u4f5c\u54c1\uff08\u300a\u897f\u6e38\u8bb0\u300b\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e5f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u96be\u7406\u89e3\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u53f0\u8bcd\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u300a\u897f\u6e38\u8bb0\u300b\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u5bf9\u5987\u5973\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u4f17\u6240\u5468\u77e5\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u82f1\u56fd\u73a9\u5bb6\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u5e26\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u5b97\u6559\u3001\u795e\u8bdd\u548c\u4e2d\u56fd\u53e4\u4ee3\uff08\u6587\u8a00\u6587\uff09\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u53f0\u8bcd\u5c06\u5e26\u6765\u4e0d\u5c0f\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u6311\u6218\u3002\n\nLet's talk about some flaws in the current game:\n1) There is no scene map, and for players who are not accustomed to exploring and wandering maps, finding their way may pose some challenges.\n2) The game does not have difficulty adjustment options, and some bosses are very challenging.\n3) The skills of the BOSS unit are not clearly indicated, making evasion difficult.\n4) There is no way to pause during cutscenes, or it is difficult for non Chinese users to read lines (subtitles are too small), and there is no way to view \"historical dialogue records\".\n\n\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u6765\u8c08\u8c08\u5f53\u524d\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\n1\uff09 \u6ca1\u6709\u573a\u666f\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u4e60\u60ef\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u6f2b\u6e38\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8def\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002\n2\uff09 \u6e38\u620f\u6ca1\u6709\u96be\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u6709\u4e9bBOSS\u975e\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\n3\uff09 BOSS\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u95ea\u907f\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\u3002\n4\uff09 \u8fc7\u573a\u52a8\u753b\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u505c\u987f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u975e\u4e2d\u6587\u7528\u6237\u5f88\u96be\u9605\u8bfb\u53f0\u8bcd\uff08\u5b57\u5e55\u592a\u5c0f\uff09\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u67e5\u770b\u201c\u5386\u53f2\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5f55\u201d\u3002",

Well above recommended PC specs, drivers are updated,  dropped graphic settings to lighten the load... so on and so forth. Hoping for some updates soon to help the issues.\n\nUpdate. Not entirely sure what the problem was but I did manage to stop the crashing in the intro fight by locking the frames to 60. Changed FRS to TSR. And dropping graphics to low. Could've been the sheer volume of particles. Gradually cranked everything back up to cinematic and have only crashed once since.",

But later on unsurprisingly out of 6 bosses or so 2 of them also stopped fighting midfight and 1 of them refused to die. I tried that boss again 3 more times to no avail. I literally cannot continue the game. Some people have no problems like I do but I also saw enough to know this isn't just happening to me. If you want to gamble go ahead but be warned.

The game isnt terrible I think i just expected more from a game that looks so good, one thing that is terrible though are some of the bosses namely yellow wind sage rat and the ice dragon are two fights that stuck out as terrible, extremely janky hit/ hurt boxes in both of those fights. Yellow wind rat was by far the worst though I seriously think this game needed more dev time to iron out some of jank. Hope they take another look at those bosses because this could be an amazing game if some of the jank is patched. Camera needs work to, lock on is almost unusable in ice dragon fight but my biggest peeve is the level design, so many invisible barriers around places that look like you should be able to go. I'm sure many will love this game for the sheer s spectacle of it all but those who care more about game play then graphics may be let down.",

        "review": "Black Myth Wukong is an absolute masterclass of a game. All the hype, all the praise, all the positive buzz surrounding this game...they're absolutely deserved and this is hands down, one of THE best games of this generation, not just this year. The combat, fluidity of animations, the level and boss design, the intricate level and environmental design, all the different characters and enemies, they're all very unique, varied and superbly crafted. When you take control of the Monkey King (Sun Wukong) you really feel the power behind that staff and every swing you make against your enemies. I won't spoil the details but the gameplay mechanic is very rich and varied and rewarding. There's a whole level up system that can be used to power up your abilities and spells which can be used in subsequent battles. This btw is not necessarily a souls-like game even though some mechanics are present there but the combat style is very fast and responsive. I'm only just scratching the surface of the game and trust me when I say, this is one of the best action RPG games I've ever played in a good while and easily among to very best the game industry has to offer. \n\nEasily a 10/10 for me. Well done Game Science for creating such a well-crafted masterpiece. You deserve all the success and praise.",

Well guess what - it's another soulsborne game with some minor twists to the formula I will get into.\n\nI deliberately bought this game to finally get some reprieve from the excessive influence Fromsoft has had on the last decade of games and it's just more of the same. The challenge lies entirely in the game obfuscating what to do.  Normal enemies are a minor nuisance, bosses are the focal point. Bosses perform devastating attacks that you need to internalize - and without having seen them performed prior you either get away with a crude, unrewarding feeling victory, or you need to repeat the same thing a few times over. I've stated before I don't like this concept. I don't like games that feel they don't need to communicate their intent. I already played all Souls games there are. I did not buy into this thinking it was just more of the same.\n\nThe combat model itself is, I suppose, a play on the existing model. Rather than stance breaking a la Sekiro, you generate Focus points by attacking (or charging). Focus points can be leveraged in a multitude of ways that allow you to take some initiative and deal big damage. You don't feel anywhere near as helpless as your average souls game - you intermittently decide the pace of the fight. \n\nI won't judge the quality of the twist, nor the admittedly great visuals - for I am wholly put off by being deceived into thinking this wasn't another soulsborne purchasing it. But it just is.",

Difficulty could use a bit of tuning though - of about 5 bosses I've beaten, the most attempts it took me to beat a boss was 2.

While the game borrows quite a bit from the typical souls-like formula, it manages to distinguish itself enough to offer a unique experience. The game also has a way heavier focus on boss fights, more than you might expect. In fact, at times, it wouldn't be a stretch to call it a borderline boss-rush, as you can sometimes face one boss right after another with barely a minute in between. \n\nTheres also the visuals. Honestly, I'm not sure if this even needs to be said, but the overall visual presentation is unquestionably among the best in the medium, just make sure to turn off the god awful framegen. Despite that, the game somehow runs pretty well.\n\nProbably the most frustrating aspect of the game so far are invisible walls, which are quite plentiful, fairly disappointing considering i thought those kind of things were left in the PS3 era, but not a huge issue on its own. So far, theres not much else i dislike about the game.\n\nOverall, this is very good stuff, and easily worth the full price tag.",

The gameplay is exceptionally smooth, with combat mechanics that, while not exactly Souls-like, offer a satisfying challenge. The learning curve for perfect dodges, enemy attack patterns, and different enemy types keeps you engaged, and the gorgeous, non-open-world level design, paired with a soothing soundtrack, adds to the immersive experience.\n\nWhile some features like a proper full-screen mode are still absent, the overall gameplay is so well-executed that these minor issues are easy to overlook. This game has Game of the Year potential, and it's a shame that Western gaming press might not have given it the recognition it deserves.\n\n I'm thrilled to play a game that doesn't require me to switch language settings, though I acknowledge that some of the story elements and cultural nuances might be tough to grasp without prior knowledge of Journey to the West. Even so, this depth adds to the game's mystery and replayability, as there's always something new to discover.\n\nIf you get stuck on any obscure content, feel free to leave a comment\u2014I\u2019ll do my best to help you out. Sharing and understanding these details together is part of what makes gaming so enjoyable.\n\nI sincerely hope Black Myth: Wukong becomes the huge success it deserves to be. Happy exploring!",

        "review": "Amazing game after a long time! Visually one of the best games of 2024, just finished chapter 1 and had very smooth experience, did face some minor stutters but nothing game breaking! The combat system feels great and no it isnt souls-like at all. There is heavy emphasis on dodge mechanism here and there is no parry system so it feels much more like playing a hybrid of bayonetta/Nier and monster hunter, the only thing in common here with souls like games is the inability to choose difficulty and the existence of stamina bar, the thing that souls like games excel is in the level design with interconnecting shortcuts and areas but this game has very linear levels and has chapter progression similar to that of new God of war game. If you are looking for a new fast paced souls like game then this isnt one, better play Sekiro instead which is no doubt one of the best games ever made.\n\nThe things I liked in this game -\n>Amazing graphics\n>Fluid Combat Systems\n>Character Design\n>Story\n\nThe things I disliked - \n> Level Design\n> Lack of maps, even a simple one would've made the game way better\n\nBlackMyth: Wukong reminded me DOTA 2 a lot since the combat has lots of BOUNDLESS STRIKES and even one of the stances reminds me of primal spring. Building focus also feels similar to building Jingu stacks so kudos to Valve for making a really great hero!",

        "review": "I got this game for free as a promotion with a graphics card I bought, I hadn't watched any trailers for it and never really looked into it. I went in with no expectations or hype whatsoever, and frankly I don't get it.\n\nThe game has terrible level design, you are bound to hit an invisible wall (even if the place you are trying to reach is part of the level, sometimes there's just an invisible wall to prevent you from going there from a specific angle for some reasons) no matter where you go, the paths also are not intuitive, I was actually going around the level trying to find what I had missed only to find out that there was a small gap to crawl in to progress hidden inside a cave, there was nothing to tell me this was there, I found it by pure chance, the combination of the invisible walls, non-intuitive levels and the lack of a map to find those paths on makes exploring very frustrating.\n\nThe combat feels wrong, sometimes you do an input mid-roll and the character does the move related to that input right after the roll, and sometimes he does not, heavy attacks have ridiculous delay to them which makes them feel terrible to use. In some fights, you could start a heavy attack before the boss starts his attack and get punished anyway. You barely do any damage to bosses and kill regular enemies way too easily, which makes the bosses the only actual challenge, well except for actually finding them, unfortunately the bosses have terrible arena designs and sometimes attack fast enough to get you with a follow-up attack right after your dodge. \n\nThe story relies way too much on the base material, if you have not read the book, none of it makes sense.\n\nThe game does look pretty, but if its not fun then why would I play it.",

It's an incredibly visually appealing game with strong production values and very cool Chinese voiceover (what? yeah!). It is also stable even with agressive alt-tabbing.\r\n\r\nThe game itself is closer to something like God of War reboot than Souls, thank goodness. There is no penalty for death and after few initial bosses you know the combat system well enough to play at your own pace.\r\n\r\nThe only downside is that not every piece of text in the game is translated so far, plus the first hour or so could be a little too cutscene-heavy.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it's a very beautiful game with deep yet easy to learn combat system and easy to follow plot.",

        "review": "After playing for 10 hours straight, I am thrilled to describe Black Myth: Wukong as my personal GOTY, or Game of the Year. For me Wukong displays many aspects that tick all the boxes for me. While not open world, the game is huge in linear fashion. You explore the beautifully put together world of Wukong fighting enemy types of many kinds. Practically no one is your friend, most are your foe. Your goal is to progress through each locale and defeat enemy after enemy. There are many foes, mini-bosses, and actual level bosses. It feels almost endless. The game does a great job keeping you busy while impressing you with quick game-play with beautiful graphic effects of many element types, such as electricity, water, thunder, fire, and mist.\n\nIt is not a Souls game nor is it a souls-like, as much as it looks to be. Many games nod toward the genre with resting at a specific location to recover heath while also re-spawning foes. For example, the Tomb Raider series does this but was never claimed as a souls-like. Black Myth: Wukong allows the player to collect and carry many things, but even after adventuring leading to the player's death, the player keeps all the items collected.\n\nThe fighting style is fun, if you're not a Souls lover, and more of a Mortal Kombat noobie, this can be fun for you. Button mashing can help you defeat many foes, and if you're a combo specialist you can be the master of brilliant combos that impress your eyes. You can improve your Wukong by purchasing new skills and traits from the items collected throughout the world. It's not difficult depending on what type of player you are.\n\nThere are only two languages at launch. Chinese and English, both come with subtitles. The voice acting is best in the developer's original language of Chinese, in my opinion.\n\nThe opening scene is peak cut scenes with game play that matches or even surpasses the quality that GOD of War displays. You will be heavily impressed from the time you start the game, given you're on a system that can handle it. For now, the game launches on PC and Sony PlayStation 5, with Xbox left in the dark of when or if those gamers will even have a chance to journey to the west. On PS5, you have three presets to choose from while on PC, you practically have an endless number of choices. I cannot speak too much on the PS5 version as I do not own a copy for that platform. PC is the 'GOD-tier' platform to choose if your hardware supports ray tracing and it gets even better if you have the hardware to play on a 4K OLED display. Your eyes will thank you for the experience.\n\nTo be honest, I can go on and on, but I really want to get back to the game so I will state this, Steam allows you to purchase and play the game for up to two-hours leaving you eligible for a refund for any reason you find yourself with buyer's remorse. So, play for 119 minutes and make a choice to keep going or get your monies back.\n\nOne last thing, because of the players in China, Black Myth: Wukong is now the only single player game to have ever had 2,223,179 concurrently players on Steam (PC) at one time. This makes it beat the latest two game of the year titles, Baldur's Gate 3 and ELDEN RING. Only second to one game, PUBG which sits as number one.",

I don't understand gamer debates over single player games, it's like everyone is so desperate for everyone else to like or dislike the things they do. It's a good game, buy it, or don't, but it is a fun game utilizing what we can expect from UE5 and solid and challenging combat. I'd give it an 8/10 on my end, but that's probably just because I have brain damage from open world games being EVERY release these days. There is something nice about linear old school movement like I am on my Gamecube or PS2 all over again. Anyways, I say give it a shot!",

They haven't optimized it, they have covered up the poor performance and quality with adaptive resolutions and extremely intense motion blur. If you are not playing the game yourself this isn't as noticeable, but if you play with motion blur off or on you'll quickly realise how bad the game looks. In the first cutscene, everything is extremely grainy. When you transform and scout the mountain, that is not a developer choice to limit your vision. It's literally the game trying to hide how terrible it looks when there is many assets on screen with motion blur. The adaptive scaling being necessary means that even if you have solid FPS, timings on dodges will still change slightly. It's extremely noticeable when you get input delay if you are going for perfect dodges. \n\nI think people are over hyped for this game, especially when it comes to the visuals. They look great on stream watching someone else play, but terrible when you play yourself.\n\nIf you're not already set on this game, you are better off saving your money until you find out if they'll actually try to optimize it, instead of giving us worse resolutions and farting in our eyes with motion blur in an AAA title.",

If you still think that this is poor performance then just don't get the game or wait until you can get a better rig. The combat is super rewarding with you use the correct skill in combination with the light and heavy attack. There's no map in the game but it only makes the world exploration more rewarding. Game science did not do us dirty and they were indeed cooking for the past three years. This game is a reminder that it is possible for studios to make good games that only focuses on the game.",

There are systemic issues in combat system not being responsive enough i.e. input delays, hit boxes not registering etc.\n\nThese issues amidst ambitious and aggressive combat become severely frustrating especially in critical moments - which can change the tide of battle - which undermine the players efforts; and especially when you progress further into the game and challenges ramp up in difficulty which then require the needed precision.\n\nIn terms of the game play experience I would recommend holding off on buying this right now and rather wait until these issues are addressed, if at all.",

        "review": "it is really good overall, graphics are obviously amazing but tech-wise this game actually excels at mid-boss transitions with really polished animations, stunts and lots of tricky gimmicks in the second half of the campaign\n\ncombat is also great but imo it works better with bosses than mobs since what you ultimately do is build up focus points to spend on heavy attacks and thats more fun to do while dodging constantly\n\nlikewise story is nice cause as i said cutscenes are really polished and character interactions are interesting and zhu bajie has some funny quirks on him, but also you need some background in order to understand some of the bosses' struggles and such, i guess if youre familiar with journey to the west you might catch some more extra insight\n\ni also think this game does a fantastic job at portraying the chinese mythos and daoist iconography, some of the latter areas are really evocative and really makes you see how many faces buddha can have. For me personally this is excellent at portraying cultural background and a massive leap forward for the wuxia genre\n\ni think if they ever make a sequel it would benefit from some platforming elements and maybe a little more puzzle solving as the zones that connect each boss get a bit shallow sometimes by chapters 4 through 6\n\nperformance is decent, i managed to run somewhat stable 60 fps on my rtx 3080 i9-10900k clocking at default speeds, it has frame generation options too even for non-nvidia graphics cards",

You have to focus on the bosses, but it feels great. It's gorgeous, plays smooth, and the skill tree is awesome. Just enough RPG to satisfy the itch, yet enough \"souls\" to make me invest. Love the Fable-esque vibes of monkeys/wolves/etc. pertaining to the setting/lore.\n\nVery much impressed of overall quality and depth. Definitely a GOTY runner up. We'll see how it holds up as I crunch in the time soaking up what it has to offer <3",

It was promised as a visual spectacle with amazing combat and boss fights and it is certainly that. While I at times get frustrated and want to quit, like I did shortly before writing this, I also feel an immense satisfaction after beating a tough enemy. Game is pretty linear as well which I like, a lot of games are TOO open these days but this one is lazer focused on action scenes. Decent customisation, mechanics and some cool build possibilities, it's a genuinely great game. The ONLY big issue I have is the lack of difficulty slider and the lack of a mini map. Look it's 2024, if you wanna be a pro Elden Ring player that's cool, but some of us just want some cool fighting combat and to beat up enemies. Not everything needs to be a GIT GOOD style game. And for people who DO want that, they can continue to play on the higher difficulties. Other than that, having a lot of fun and even though I need a break for now because of those damn archers killing me, I will be back.",

This isn't just any game; it's a masterful adaptation of one of China's most beloved tales, the timeless \"Journey to the West,\" a novel that has captivated hearts since 1592 and stands proudly among the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature.\n\nWhat sets this game apart is its deep roots in a narrative so rich and enduring that every NPC you encounter doesn't just exist for the sake of the game; they are drawn straight out of literary history, each with a backstory echoing through centuries. The attention to detail is staggering\u2014from the lush environments to the dynamic cloud systems in the sky, which react impressively to your movements during combat, adding an immersive layer of interaction that is rarely seen in video games.\n\nI urge you not just to play the game but to opt for the deluxe edition. This version includes a soundtrack that is nothing short of a cultural treasure trove, featuring reimagined versions of musical pieces that have been woven into the very fabric of Chinese heritage. Black Myth: Wukong is not merely a game; it's an experience\u2014a bridge between ancient folklore and modern entertainment\u2014and it's an experience that no gamer should miss out on.\n\nFor 32:9 display we can use this patch: https://github.com/Lyall/UltrawidePatches/tree/main/Black%20Myth%20Wukong\n",

This game does everything right I cannot recommend enough.

Here are some of the issues I see so far:\n\n1. No Boss checkpoints. I cant remember the last game that had me walk to a boss from halfway of the map each time I died. It's not a game breaker but an aging design choice that even Fromsoft has abandoned.\n2. Cant skip phase cutscenes. I have to watch the phase transition each time I need to repeat the boss\n3. No audio Cues. This game has no audio cue for dodging nor does it give any visual cue either aside from the boss animation. I dont mind the absence of visual cue as long as there is an audio chime or something.\n4. Bugs. I've encountered several bugs so far from boss teleports around the stage to a mob flying into the sky to my enemies not regretting my hits.\n5. Game is confused. the game doesn't know what genre it wants to be which causes some fights to be a mess. on one hand you feel like this is a dodge and counter type boss but then it just wants you to mash buttons.\n\nThis game has potential that I hope get addressed and fixed and like I said earlier this is clearly their first major game and they did a fantastic job but still needs some quality of life fixes.",

        "review": "I'm just going to type about the game because I am not a game reviewer, nor do I have expertise on Game Development. However, I've played video games consistently since the early 2000's. This game is good looking. The cinematic elements of the game are a nice touch but it doesn't make up for the fact that the fighting mechanics are not done well. The common enemies are eliminated by button mashing. While the elite enemies tend to have heavy attacks that you dodge once and then spam mash light attack until their HP is gone. This is early game that I'm talking about so it might be possible to have other abilities later on. This review has come to be after I fought the second boss (The water snake noble guy) and can't beat him. Is it because I don't want to be patient? Absolutely I don't want to be patient! But his attacks (I felt the same way about the first boss) are too difficult to read, and I spend my time spam dodging until he's done. I've played and beaten both Dark Souls 3 and Elden Ring (DLC Included) and this game is just mechanically clunky. The fights just feel like you take turns attacking. There is not a defensive strategy early on. I can't block (except archers' arrows but I've only run into 2 of them), I can't parry, and I can't counter.\r\n\r\nThe game looks good, feels ok, but overall the fighting aspect (at least early on) is mechanically impossible to actually feel like a Martial Arts Monkey. I think my only issues is how narrow and closed in the beginning feels. I get that there isn't an open world aspect and that it is very linear. Which in games like Sekiro are fine because it felt like there was some level of exploration. This game locks you into a path that says \"Get good\" but cares more about creating a challenging Fromsoft experience without the vast equipment or abilities that Fromsoft gifts to their players with their choices of character creation. Again, not a game reviewer, just a frustrated gamer that spent $60 on another game that doesn't feel fine tuned. (just feels like with all the open world games nowadays, companies don't know how to create efficient linear maps).\r\n\r\nI am not returning this and do plan on trying to beat it, but not because I love the video game, but because I love video games.  I could recommend this game for certain types of players, just not ones like me.",

It also looks fantastic and runs surprisingly well (7800x3d + 3080 ti, getting 70-90 fps with RT off and everything on Very High).\n\nVery strong recommend out the gate. I have to stop playing and go to bed but I want more badly.\n\nedit: Played it a bit more at lunch and still enjoying it. The first boss f-ed me up a few times but overall this is easier than a FromSoft game. I also am really enjoying the quick spells / form changes, seems to add a nice diversity to the combat and strategy.",

        "review": "Dont let the people saying \"Chinese Bots spamming Reviews\" discourage you from giving this game a try. If 96% of 200,000 reviews isnt enough to get you to try the game a few more things to look forward to are as follows-\n\nCombat-\nDeceptively simple at first, seeming like a crap ton of light attack spam until you start to look into the different skill trees. Truly one of the most densely packed combat systems I have ever seen. While Im sure you might be able to play the entire game light attack spamming and spam rolling there is a giant amount of room for you to express some skill. With about 76 (a random large number) different parry systems and combos you will quickly realize that there is PLENTY of different ways to take on this game.\nEnvironment/Looks-\nI truly dont understand how people can say the game doesnt look gorgeous, not to mention the level design in general is amazing. Its not just \"dressed up straight lines\" as another person declared its truly dynamic and beautiful. Each chapter of the game showing off something completely different its impossible to get bored of the look, not to mention stopping several times to just admire the game.\nPerformance-\nNow obviously with such a gorgeous game on UE5 its going to be difficult to run thats sort of a given. That being said its no where near impossible a specific review I saw claimed they were on a 4080 SUPER and could hardly run it. Well with my drivers all up to date and everything properly taken care of, on the MAX settings with ray tracing AND an ultrawide (3440;1440) I ran the game above 100 fps almost ALWAYS and rarely could tell if upscaling was needing to do anything at all. Ive heard bad things about AMD obviously I cant speak on that, but a friend of mine owns a 1660 SUPER and was still capable of playing the benchmark (which has been completely accurate for me in testing) at 70 fps on medium ray tracing off.\nStory-\nAgain something that is admittedly subjective, and I LOVE the chinese mythos as well as the story of wukong in general. The way they present every fight, the cinematics at the end of each chapter, and how they bring it all together is just beyond words. Not to mention the sheer amount of extra lore you can read or find in alternate areas is something that I just cannot describe as anything other than amazing. Now obviously the lip syncing does not match at all with the English dub, from what I can tell and have been told the game was dubbed in Mandarin, so I mean yeah obviously it wont be the same, but the voice acting itself is top notch.\nPrice-\nSixty dollars is obviously a lot of money but hey at least its not seventy like most games these days, I think its absolutely worth the price I wont miss a single dollar. But waiting for a sale if you cannot afford it is never a bad thing.\nMonke-\nMonke\nSoulsLike-\nThe developers have been stressing to every reviewer and everybody in general that this is not meant to be a souls-like. There are some obvious similarities with the checkpoint system and the roll focused combat and the challenging bosses. But I would agree that if I had to draw a similarity, its more closely related to God of War or something of that nature. Rarely does it feel like im playing a souls-like. \nConclusion-\nThe game is AMAZING, and my general rule for this kind of thing is to NOT listen to reviewers hell, I have never reviewed a game before I just loved this game so much. But for the love of god if the reviewer has less than 2 hours played and the product is refunded and they claim to know all about the story being boring and the combat being awful the level design being trash without even PLAYING 5% OF THE GAME. Just play it for yourself, and you can form your own opinion.",

        "review": "[h1] A GEM AMONG GEMS [/h1]\n\nIn the age of continuous releases of modern garbage meant for the ever so absent \"modern audiences\", Black Myth: Wukong is not just a gem but a very much needed wake up call for all. Not only does the game respect its players, the sincerity to stay true to lore while adding its own spin and flare to expand upon a beloved mythological tale highlights the care and respect Game Science has for their work.\n\n[h2][b] Lore & Story [/b][/h2]\nThe game takes place after the story of Journey to the West, where the legendary QiTianDaSheng (Wukong) returns to his home HuaGuoShan after refusing immortality from the Celestials. After a fight takes place between the two parties, Wukong is defeated and supposedly sealed back into the stone at the top of the mountain. The story then begins when a prominent young descendent takes up the mantle in hopes of collecting the legendary artifacts left behind by Wukong and to one day live up to his predecessor's legend.\n\n[h2][b] Gameplay [/b][/h2]\nWhile comparable to the Souls genre, Black Myth: Wukong is NOT a Souls game. Progression in general is much easier and the power fantasy is definitely a focus. As such, players will feel much stronger as they level and upgrade without needing to worry about the lost of progress from dying.\n\nThe combat is dynamic and powerful, especially with every swing of your staff synchronizing to the vibration of your controller. Enemy variety is immense, and while the file and ranks do fall easily, players will also need to strategize against larger groups of them to succeed. This is made easier with unlockable abilities that can be upgraded in different directions paired with stance upgrades which directly impact your fighting style and combos.\n\nItemization is also extremely diverse in this game, with armour giving unique set bonuses and your healing gourd having special effects as well. Players will also see the use of a curios system where unique items can be equipped to give minor boosts to stats or combat bonuses. As players progress and collects more materials, better armour can be crafted along with the option to upgrade the weapon which all comes with unique visuals and effects.\n\n[h2][b] Bosses [/b][/h2]\nThe main focus of this game is the bosses, and there are many ranging from story bosses to open world optional bosses. Due to the fantastic combat system, every boss fight feels like a cinematic highlight. The music is as gorgeous as the environment, and both fit the theme of the boss extremely well. Players will need to think on the fly and devise the best way to tackle the boss, with some needing rapid attacks to pressure out of ranged retaliations and others needing players to be always on the move. And true to Wukong's lore, some defeated bosses can drop their spirits which players can absorb. Said spirits can be used to transform mid combat, allowing players to utilize certain attacks once belonging to the bosses players defeated earlier. This is diversity done right. \n\n[h2][b] Visuals [/b][/h2]\nUtilizing the power of Unreal Engine 5, Black Myth: Wukong is possibly one of the best looking games on the market today. The environment is diverse and expansive, with lush forests echoing the sound of crickets, streams, and rustling leaves, to barren wastelands and its blazing sun, players are presented the very best of what modern technology has to offer.\n\n[h2][b] Finishing Thoughts [/b][/h2]\nBlack Myth: Wukong is the epitome of passion and creative abundance. As of current, it has surpassed major titles like Elden Ring and Cyberpunk in all time player count at 2.2 millions while peaking at 1.4 million the night of launching. Not only does it excel in narrative and lore, it is visually stunning and audibly magnificent. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, especially those who attempt to pick apart this gem through desperate political theatrics and DEI drama. Remember: if you think you hate game journalists enough, you don't.\n\nFinal score: 10/10 Strongly recommend for all",

Instead, you can dodge by climbing onto your weapon, using skills, and so much more...\n\nIts like a combination of EldenRing and Naraka, which gives you immersive feelings. \nIt is very hard to describe, it's like Boxing in real life. You know when to through a punch and when not to. You know when to kick and when to dodge. \n\nAbsolutely awesome experience. Its good to see a Made in China 3A video game went a step further and pursue whats beyond.\n\nWorth the price, highly recommend, take my money comrade.",

        "review": "[[I am going to change my review after doing some testing and research. For transparency I will leave it as several of the points are valid issues a new person may want to prepare for.\n\nTo address the loading and other issues, I have to admit I am not a PC guy. I don't have a 'potato' but I also was not fooled into getting the most expensive graphics cards on the market and looking like a fool yelling into the review section (perks of having an IT friend build my stuff, haha). If ANYONE is having the issues I described with Loading and/or stuttering please insure you are installed onto an SSD. I had the game on a secondary drive that was not an SSD and when I reinstalled it as a test on my actual SSD after cleaning it up my load time was only about 2-3 minutes to get into the game and no lagging or stuttering. This game was made for an SSD as most these days are and it might be a solid solution if you have not tried that.]]\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\nI want to love this game but I had to uninstall it. Its not worth the stress it caused me. Its gorgeous and well within the theme of the setting but the game play is un-playable for me. The issues are all at launch, if the game is refined at a late date, this may change.\n\n1) The loading is bad. Like, 10 minutes to get into the game bad. \n2) Memory issues cause the game to lag periodically. Its usually only when first loaded, but when you have to sit in 10 minutes worth of loading just to launch the game, its painful to have to wait for the INGAME processing to finish.\n3) Combat is quite impossible for me. Every boss has floats in their attacks, making the visually obvious moments to dodge too soon. Add to this the fact that bosses with have attack patterns that lead several attacks in a row, none of which are on a rhythm and it is quite hard to get a good handle on when to dodge. And that's not counting any of the quick attacks that you just have to know is coming or the bosses with phases that leave them mostly invisible while attacking. \n4) Damage calculations seem a bit too extreme. You will do chip damage and need to land many combos to see a boss' health bar drop but they will catch you and backhand you doing a poor dodge and you will lose almost all of your health. This is with best gear at the time and as much HP as I was able to get. The solution is 'eat the damage mitigation pill' but that's not really a solution its a crutch. Honestly, I felt that gear didnt really do anything for me, as each time I got an upgrade it was still slightly behind the current content and didn't feel like it had an impact.\n5) Spells are set up as your go-to solution for a lot of issues but there is little to no mana regen apart from resting at a shrine and resetting mobs. This tended to leave me empty of mana when enter a boss room for the first time and then caused extra work to get to the boss rooms on subsequent attempts with mana intact. \n\nI really love the games system and wanted to enjoy it. I pre-ordered and pre-installed it then counted down the hours to release. But after playing for 10 hours I have learned that this game is sadly not for me. If these are not issues for you, please give it a try. But if you are like me and have issues with these dodge-heavy games that keep putting floats and pauses in their boss attacks just to make it hard to anticipate attacks, maybe look else where.",

        "review": "So far I'm liking the game, but the amount of invisible walls preventing me from further exploring the world is annoying, it completely breaks the immersion and takes me out of the experience.\n\nGame Science, please have more confidence in Your Game Design and allow players to fully explore the maps, even if there's not a single item or enemy, putting invisible walls in all places, specially those set pieces that look like alternative explorable paths is a terrible idea, it takes players out of the game and discourages exploration.\n\nAll You had to do was allow players to explore small areas of those places regardless of the lack of content and the experience would have been much better.\n\nI've come across so many invisible walls by Chapter One and Two that I'm no longer exploring every nook and cranny of the game world.\n\nGameplay wise, the game is good. You're a Monke, You Bonk mystical beings with your staff, and avoid paying taxes, pretty monke-like if I do say so myself.\n\nEDIT: The game has major performance issues from Chapter 2 on-wards and needs to be optimized.\n\nApart from the performance issues; I've found that despite the crazy amount of invisible walls, this game does reward keen exploration, a lot of content is easily missable or hidden from players, but if You manage to find the right path You will be rewarded with secret content that is not accessible otherwise.\n\nI really like that, rewarding players for engaging with the game and looking out for Key Items or clues is amazing, and the boss fights that come with that content are pretty good too!\n\nCombat wise, I feel like this game has an identity crisis, because it doesn't know if it wants to be a Souls-like or a game like God of War. Combos are few and quite limited, each stance has one main combo and that's it, Thrust Stance has 2 Combos and that makes it the best stance in the game.\n\nYou're going to be using the same combos thought your whole playthrough. I honestly feel like they should have added way more moves, or make it like in Yakuza, where the MC has different fighting styles that completely change his moveset, at first the Staff Stances seem to be pointing out on that direction, but no. They just add a few moves, and don't change the Light Attack Combos.\n\nStamina management should not be in the game, period. It just detracts from the experience all together making the game unnecessarily annoying to play sometimes, and Mana should be replenished over-time or by defeating enemies in my opinion because it runs out so quickly.\n\nLike I said, BMW doesn't know if it wants to be a full-blown out Action game or a Souls-Like, and it ends up being a weird mesh between the genres. \n\nFor example, You have an Estus Flask, You got Bonfires, You have Stamina management, You have to commit to attacks because You cannot cancel them, Enemies and bosses deal an absurd amount of damage. Those are Souls-Like elements.\n\nBut You also have Generous Over-the-top moves that give You breathing time, such as the Freeze Ability, the Pillar Stance charge attack, the transformations, the Thrust Stance Light>Heavy>Heavy Combo and else.\n\nI just feel like the Developers felt pressured to make this game a Souls-Like because they weren't feeling confident in their ability to make their own thing. But this game should have been 100% an Action Game with a Gameplay more akin to God of War or Yakuza.\n\nLast but not least, there's not that many Transformations which is very disappointing. Apparently there's only 5? I thought that the idea was to be able to transform in most of the main bosses, but no. The game only gives You the ability to transform into 'certain' enemies.\n\nAnd no, Spirits don't count as Transformations because You don't get to play as the Spirit. They function more as optional abilities that recharge. Taking damage while using Spirit Abilities also sucks, I thought they made You invincible for the attack duration but no, You will get hit when using Spirit abilities which is just a bad idea since the animations are way to long and sluggish.\n\nTDLR: I wish the game leaned more into being a Fun Action game, the Souls-Like elements really hurt the overall experience and enjoyment that I'm getting from the game, and some of the mechanics or systems are either too under develop, or underwhelming at best. Primerely the Staff Stances not having their OWN Light Attack Movesets like in Yakuza, the lack of more Transformations, the way everything stun locks You or staggers You, Spirits being in the game feels like an after-thought, as if they were initially transformations that got turned into abilities for lack of development time.",

        "review": "Having a lot of fun with this game.  Runs ok on steam deck on low settings as well with some tweaking.  I am about 4 hours into the game, and beaten a couple of the bosses.  The only thing I have an issue with is the combat is a bit boring after a while as I so far only have the staff and there isn't any variety like having other weapons besides different upgrades and skins for the staff.  Maybe that changes later in the game, but so far there is no indication of it.  This game is fun, and I recommend it if you like a dark souls type game.  It is similar to that, Jedi Fallen Order, and God of War being it's the same type of game but Chinese mythology instead of Greek/Norse mythology.  Overall 8/10.",

        "review": "Suck it, kotaku.\n\n8/10\n\nHonestly I wouldn\u2019t say it is a masterpiece but most of the gameplay is pretty badass. Besides some performance issues the game is quite fun for me.\nIs it souls-like? Not really, it is more like Monster Hunter or Sekiro, or all of the souls-like game combined and tuned down a level; in simple terms, it\u2019s an RPG, a really hard RPG game.\nI understand that some of you guys have some bias on Chinese studios, or you really believe those \u201cdiversity\u201d  propaganda bullcrap. I only want to try the game myself, it\u2019s okay to have your thoughts, so I\u2019ll also have my own.\nNow let\u2019s be a jerk. Since I\u2019ve played a couple of souls-like games myself, I can clearly see what the devs were going. I have a strong vibe of early souls-like like Dark Souls 2, and some elements of Monster Hunter and Hollow Knight. The game has some unique combat implemented but it mainly feels like a lot of things were \u201csutured together\u201d and I really don\u2019t know how to transcribe it since it gave me a mixed experience while combatting. But if you\u2019re a new player experiencing this type of games, then it is for you, cause it\u2019s easy as hell compared to other souls-likes.\nNow, performance issues. I\u2019ve heard a lot of things about stuttering & black screens. I didn\u2019t experience it myself, but most of the time my frame rate was around 60~90 so I wouldn\u2019t say it is terrible. But sometimes when there\u2019re a lot of particles, it will drop to around 20~30, which is really bad since half of the bosses have particles around them. You can tune the graphics down a little bit to \u201cneutralize\u201d the issue but I know you all want that big juicy scenery all the time without loosing your frame rate, right? So yeah, I hope they\u2019ll fix it asap.\nGenerally I don\u2019t want to write something so long I don\u2019t even want to read, but I think it\u2019s necessary to tell everyone my honest opinion of this game, and my stand that I don\u2019t give a F about the ones who don\u2019t play games, cause I play games. So take that, IGN.\nOne thing I forgot to mention is the utterly stupid fking translation, especially English (since I launched the game with that crap) and I just couldn\u2019t continue playing until I swapped it back to Simplified Chinese. I kinda understand why the translation is so bad cause most of the content is just Chinese mythology and fictions, but I really do think they\u2019re not even trying. Do better, okay? This is the only crap that pissed me off. Don\u2019t ask, I\u2019m Chinese. I do know the difference between the two.\n\u4e0b\u8fb9\u8fd9\u6bb5\u8bdd\u662f\u7ed9\u4e2d\u56fd\u73a9\u5bb6\u8bf4\u7684\uff0c\u53d1\u81ea\u5185\u5fc3\u7684\u4e00\u53e5\u529d\u3002\u5148\u628a\u6e38\u620f\u73a9\u4e86\uff0c\u522b\u5728\u8fd9\u513f\u53d1\u4ec0\u4e48\u6ca1\u7528\u7684B\u73a9\u5e94\u513f\uff0c\u6709\u597d\u7684\u5c31\u5938\uff0c\u89c9\u5f97\u4e0d\u597d\u7684\u4f60\u5c31\u6279\u8bc4\uff0c\u597d\u73a9\u5c31\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u4e0d\u597d\u73a9\u5c31\u4e0d\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u522b\u6401\u8fd9\u91cc\u8ddf\u6211\u8bb2\u60c5\u6000\uff0c\u54b1\u82b1\u4e86\u94b1\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u4f53\u9a8c\u6e38\u620f\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u662f\u6765\u770b\u522b\u4eba\u8138\u8272\u7684\u3002\uff08\u9664\u975e\u662f\u522b\u4eba\u7ed9\u6211\u4e70\u7684\uff09",

I can see the producers/devs put massive efforts on this game, and give birth to such a masterpiece of eastern fantasy world. There is one that could be improved for sure, better in-game guidance (mini-map or directional tool at least to tell me north/south), and no other complaints. I have played for around 10 hours, and just finished first chapter. No crash, no lagging, no issues from game itself. Kudos to Game Science team! Great game and good job!",

        "review": "I honestly don't know if i can recommend this game to anyone except die hard fans of the original story. Sadly the only thing positive i can say about the game is that it is BREATHTAKING to look at, good GOD they did such a good job with it. Other than that I have many problems with the game.\n\nLet's start with the biggest sin of the game imo the story (or lack there of). As someone who has not read the journey to the west story and only has a very basic knowledge of the story i am so confused as to what is going on. I'm half way through chapter 2 and the only thing i can say about the story is that I am a monkey and i have bonked many things because the game said so. It seems like the developers just expect everyone to have read the story and understand whats going on.\n\nNext sin the combat. First i'd like to say that the actual combat feels great, nothing groundbreaking but fun. My biggest issue is the amount of bosses and the miniscual amount of damage you do to them. In the first chapter you fight 5 or 6 bosses, most of them happen one right after another. Even when i upgraded my weapons I tickled most of the bosses i fought while they took out a quarter of my health with one hit. This game obviously takes inspiration from god of war and jedi survivors however the one thing they didn't incorporate from those games is a difficulty option. If they wanted to make it more of a souls like game, they should've allowed for greater weapon customization to compensate for the minuscule amount of damage your base weapon does. Instead they give you a stick and expect you to just keep bonking the bosses until they stop moving. While I do acknowledge this can be fun for some people, I found it infuriating. Another big issue with some of the fights is the camera, at the end of chapter 1 you fight a random bear dude who loves to dash from one end of the arena to the other. While on paper this sounds fun, in execution the camera constantly jumping everywhere makes it hard to read the bosses movements and dodge accordingly. Another aspect of the combat that infuriates me is the skills. While yes the skills your given are really cool, they aren't as big of a help as you would think. Take for instance the freeze skill. Every time i used it, it was a guessing game for how long it would last. Sometimes it would last for 10 seconds and other times it would last for a single second, there were even times it didn't work period. The skills also use your \"mana\" however you are given no way of recovering your mana other than using rest points. So once your mana runs out, these skills which are vital to the gameplay are no longer available to you and you're back to using your stick which does no damage. \n\nThe last sin I want to talk about is level design. While yes the maps are GORGEOUS and exploration is highly encouraged, the problem lies in the absurd amount of invisible walls throughout some of the maps. Every time i saw what looked like a path i could explore i was stopped by an invisible wall. Exploring parts of the map i was allowed to explore also wasn't that rewarding, I often found myself walking in circles because the path you were supposed to follow wasn't made clear and most of the \"rewards\" you find are either in game currency or another boss which rewards you with a lackluster skill.\n\nOverall if you're that desperate for a god of war/jedi survivor type game go ahead and play this. But be warned this game isn't as polished as those games are. If you want to experience the journey to the west story DO NOT play this game, nothing is explained and you'll probably just end up as confused as i am.",

It weaves a captivating narrative filled with unexpected twists and turns, keeping me engaged and eager to uncover more. The depth and complexity of the plot not only pay homage to the original tale but also add refreshing elements that make it feel both familiar and novel.\n \nThe graphics are simply stunning. The detailed environments, from lush forests to ancient temples, and the meticulously designed characters and monsters are a visual treat. The use of lighting and special effects creates an immersive world that draws you in completely.\n \nThe combat system is highly addictive. The variety of skills and abilities at Wukong's disposal, along with the smooth animations and precise controls, make every battle a thrilling experience. The strategic element of adapting to different enemy types and exploiting their weaknesses keeps the gameplay challenging and rewarding.\n \nThe sound design is another standout feature. The background music sets the mood perfectly, enhancing the atmosphere and intensifying the emotional impact of the game. The sound effects of weapons clashing and spells being cast add a layer of authenticity to the combat.\n \nOverall, Black Myth: Wukong is a remarkable achievement that showcases the talent and dedication of the development team. It is a game that I would highly recommend to any gamer, and I am looking forward to seeing more from this franchise in the future.\"",

        "review": "EXPOSING THE TRUTH OF THIS GAME: Dota 2 has a \"you win some, you lose some\" algorithm. If you're an average or bad player, you might not ever notice. The developers know that if someone wins all the time, they'll get bored and quit. Same goes for bad players who lose all the time. So the matchmaking algorithm is rigged to put 10 players together 5v5 based on their statistics and data. So if you have won some in a row, or more wins than loses, you will find yourself thinking... wow this match sucks... its like its rigged. Yeah. That's because it is rigged. And can you exit the game? NOPE. You're chained to the mouse and keyboard for up to 1 hour just to please this algorithm. If you quit, you'll be given a penalty. IF you get a lot of penalties, and or reports, you will be put in a HIDDEN SHADOWBAN matchmaking pool. This is where they put half the cheaters and a lot of the toxic players. \"A taste of your own medicine\" type. Lovely rule to match the \"you win some, you lose some\" rule. But the problem is, even if you aren't toxic, or don't cheat, if you have high reports from being too good or from getting MVP for the match or general reports out of jealous if you understand the basic dota game, you will be put in the hidden pool anyway because th algorithm thinks you're either a cheater or toxic. But don't worry, even if you never get put in this hidden pool, you'll still meet these players in the normal matchmaking because of course Valve does not ban cheaters. If they did, they'd lose, what, 20 to 50 percent of customers and profits? Why ban them and lose money when you can just pretend and say you're making efforts to stop cheating but actually do nothing. Actually, they market cosmetic in game \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 items around the specific heros that are best used to cheat at because they are most popular of course. So yeah they don't care about the players. At all. Another reason they don't ban cheaters, is because in Dota at least, cheaters are MORE LIKELY to buy in game cosmetic items and spend cash than non cheaters. This is because MOST dota cheats cost around \u00a38 a month from forums or online site communities that sell the constantly updated mods. People for some reason use the word hack so I will for the sake of it but of course it is just game mods. Map hack, auto ability to kill last hit hero or creep, auto ability to help escape, auto ability to help attack, full vision even in fog of war (same as map hack), and other cheats. \nDota is such an iconic and classic game. And an amazing real time strategy game that looks amazing too. Unfortunately, it is COMPLETELY UNPLAYABLE.  If you're good, even good enough to power through and beat the cheating, then automatically it is assumed that you are also cheating. And you can't leave the rigged games. And you can't go AFK because it knows and gives you a penalty, And the team reports you too anyway. So you have NO CHOICE. But to be a slave chained to the screen ENDURING 4 low intelligent teammates argue and rage at each other and at you because the game is rigged and if you even try to tell them its rigged and to just stay in the base and wait for it to finish in 20 minutes instead of having to endure 1 hour+ of absolute torture, they will think you're insane. \nAnyway, if you do go ahead and install this awful game, 1. Mute all the chat settings. 2. Never ever engage in chat. Because you then give mentally ill people a live audience. DON'T EVEN TYPE 1 LETTER EVEN IF THE CHAT SEEMS FRIENDLY. It is a TRAP. 3. Don't ever try or expect to progress any type of level, or stats, kill/death ratio, win/lose ratio, commends, anything. Because its all pointless. A false promise. 4. Try to remember that the matches are rigged so you don't get annoyed! 5. Know in advance, that 90% of games, because of the messed up algorithm, mean that you either have 100% won even if you have a nap or go make a sandwich, or 100% lose, even if you are cheating yourself. SUPER EASY WIN or SUPER EASY LOSE. There's no challenge. Its automatic. But make sure you keep buying cosmetics and spending money to see the \"victory\" screen at the end of the game, 50%. of. the. time. regardless. of. anything. at. all. \nP.S. by hidden shadowban pool, i dont mean low priority pool. That's different. in 2024 I think they might have actually got rid of the shadowban pool but its no better. Plus, you now need 100 game hours to play ranked. and you will hope and pray that after 100 hours of unranked, you will be free from the toxic players and cheaters on alt accounts. Nope. They continue all the way up to high ranks. Because nobody gets banned. Because it effects revenue \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3. BUT YEAH ENJOY THIS EXPERTLY PHYSIOLOGICAL TRAP OF A GAME :D. Can't wait for this real genuine fair review to get removed by a developer for exposing the truth.",

        "review": "This review is coming from someone who initially started playing DOTA back in the days, moved to DOTA 2 when it first got launched and some years later moved again to League. I haven't touched DOTA 2 since around 2017.\r\n\r\nWhat kept me away mostly was the duration of the matches. Some even went for more than 50 minutes and this for me was just not a viable option.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried now Turbo Mode, everything changed. This mode allows you to have faster games even to League and it packs all the good stuff and fun in it. It's a rush mode, but in itself, the games does not feel rushed. It might at first, because you will see your leveling up and building items, but slowly you will adapt to the pacing and see that it does not make a huge change in terms of pacing.\r\n\r\nOther than that, DOTA has some of the best mechanics out there and in my opinion, they are way superior than League's, simply because of the amount of extra actions you can do as a player throughout the match.\r\nComplexity does bring a little barrier though, because even if I have not seen as much toxicity, what I can say that people are not so friendly to new players. But with enough patience, you can ignore them (the reporting system is also very good, every report I made for toxic players, brought actions towards them and the game confirms it for you when) and there is also a new player mode.\r\n\r\nThe game has a fairly good tutorial system and a new player mode, which could help with that. The tutorial is pretty long and it's full of short scenarios that teach the mechanics in-game. It is really good compared to other MOBA's, which simply lack this at all.\r\n\r\nThe monetization system is also much more player-friendly than other games, such as League.\r\nThere is the aspect of loot-boxes, but the game does not limit you to use the community market to buy skins for prices as low as 0.04 per an entire skin set. Most of them are around an euro/two, but still, nothing even close to the 10/20 euro skins in League.\r\nAs far as I know, every new skin released can be traded one year after it was implemented to the game, so if you wanna save some money, you can simply wait and buy the previous released skins for a much cheaper price.\r\n\r\nYou can also try the Arcade, which is basically custom maps with custom mechanics. Personally, i LOVE to play Tower Defence modes and the Arcade mode has a few of them.\r\n\r\nUltimately, DOTA is a beautiful game, complex in its own way and will guarantee you fun if you approach it in that way. So give it a try and see for yourself.",

I bought some skins too!!   My first match with players against bots, a player on the team had 82 kills!!! He killed so much so fast no one could keep up and it was quite annoying, this player with over 1000 hours in the game has sucked the fun out but whatever, it's only one match....  My second match wasn't much better so I decided to just go unranked pvp matches...every match I played I was thoroughly destroyed, camped at my spawn point, spawn, die, repeat.... every match lasts almost an hour.   When i look at my opponents they have 5k hours in this game, it's incredibly unbalanced matchmaking.  Every match I played was against people with 100's-1000's more hours than me.\nAfter watching videos on youtube and going back to playing against bots until I learn all the hero's and their abilities, I realized I would need to invest a hardcore amount of time to even be decent but the misery and frustration that would required to git gud just isn't worth my time.  I tried to like this game, I put in time and effort and even some cash on those skins but this game hates new players of the game/genre.  It's just not fun.",

They destroyed the primary tournament, the Internationals, by effectively making there no reason to buy in-game items to fuel the prize pool; but thats not really what I want to review here.\n\nI have just shy of 2k hours in this game and the most important, precise, concise, and clear review I can possibly give, both applicable to anyone between veterans and beginners to MOBAs... DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective the game is incredibly heavy in its requirements for knowledge and mechanical ability, which normally would be fine, but you will spend 99% of your time in this game with people that arent from the server region youre playing on, and they will have 0 ability to communicate with you. 100% of the players will spend the entire game pinging, feeding, trolling, being generally awful and unaware. On top of this 75% of my games consist of constant pausing because foreigners keep DCing. 80% of the games feel like absolute steamrolls one way or the other and are in an unchangable state by 20 minutes. That doesnt mean itll be a 20minute game though, it means the game will get drug out to 45-55 minutes because there is no surrender option and people would rather hold you in the prison, farming ego kills than finishing the game.\n\nA lot of players believe the game rate is 40% of the games you have no chance to win, 40% you have almost no chance to lose, 20% are close, actually playable games; how true that is, no idea, but it sure feels like its accurate.\n\nTL;DR: the game is a cesspool of no chance to communicate to try to win, people that you effectively cant play with plaguing you, and no way to actually get out of games in a timely manner. Go play any other moba.",

        "review": "DOTA 2 offers a deeply engaging and strategic gameplay experience that I genuinely enjoy. The game's complexity and depth are remarkable, with a vast array of heroes and items to master. The strategic elements, from drafting heroes to coordinating team fights, provide endless opportunities for tactical play and personal improvement. The visual and audio design also enhance the immersive experience, making each match feel intense and rewarding.\n\nHowever, one major aspect that keeps me from fully diving into the game is the community. As someone who prefers playing solo, I find the DOTA 2 community to be quite intimidating. The high skill ceiling and the often harsh environment can make it challenging for newcomers or solo players to feel comfortable. The learning curve is steep, and without a supportive team or a group of friends, it can sometimes feel overwhelming and discouraging.\n\nDespite this, DOTA 2 remains a thrilling game with a strong competitive scene and a rich lore. The solo experience can still be enjoyable, especially when experimenting with different heroes and strategies. For those willing to brave the competitive atmosphere, DOTA 2 offers a rewarding and intricate MOBA experience. Just be prepared for a challenging community environment if you\u2019re going it alone.",

Everything is broken so nothing is broken. There is an item that is flash but 5x longer on a 15 second cooldown but its balance by not being useable for 3 seconds after taking champion damage. There is an item that gives %60 magic damage reduction and for 9 seconds you can't be cc'ed but its balanced by the 9 seconds going down by 1 second every use until its 5. There are so many small complex systems and items that make this a very fun game to learn if you come from another moba.  Dota is the og and it shows I still love other mobas but this one is pretty sick if you give it a chance.",

I was particularly struck by the optimization; the game runs smoothly even on mid-range systems, a testament to its excellent engineering. The mechanics are intricate and layered, offering an exceptional depth of strategy. However, this complexity may prove daunting for newcomers. That said, for those willing to invest the time, the rewards are substantial. There are occasional bugs, but they are far and few, and rarely impact gameplay. The overall experience is exhilarating, constantly pushing you to enhance your skills and outwit your opponents. Dota 2 exceeded my expectations and solidified itself as a titan of its genre.\u200d",

Whatever you do keep away from this dog sh.it game at all cost, its only going to do you more bad than good since the game is so great to the point that it pairs you up with people that are a complete opposite of you no matter what you do. I wasted so much time on this trash game but atleast you can still save yourself before its too late.",
