On one hand, the improved graphics, detailed environments, and new physics add a modern touch to the classic Counter-Strike formula. Smoke grenades that interact with bullets and the environment in a more realistic way are a particularly nice touch. However, these improvements come at a cost. Performance issues, including frame drops and stuttering, are common, even on high-end systems, detracting from the experience, especially in a game where every millisecond counts.\n\nThe core gameplay remains familiar, but some of the changes, like weapon rebalancing and tweaks to the economy system, feel unnecessary and disrupt the flow that many players have come to love. Instead of enhancing the experience, these alterations can feel like a step back, making the game less enjoyable for those who have spent years mastering the original mechanics.\n\nPerhaps the most significant issue, though, is the lack of an effective anti-cheat system. Cheating remains rampant, and despite promises of improvements, it\u2019s clear that the current measures aren\u2019t enough. Encountering cheaters in competitive matches is a frequent frustration, and it significantly undermines the integrity of the game. The presence of cheaters, coupled with an anti-cheat system that feels ineffective, makes it difficult to enjoy the competitive aspect of [i] Counter-Strike 2[/i].\n\nIn summary, [i] Counter-Strike 2 [/i] offers some improvements but is bogged down by performance issues, controversial gameplay changes, and a persistent cheating problem. While there are moments of enjoyment, the game often feels like a missed opportunity to truly elevate the series. If you\u2019re a fan of the franchise, there\u2019s some fun to be had, but be prepared for a fair share of frustrations along the way.",

    "review": "I still play the game often and I like it, but I leave a negative review because I don't like the direction it's taken. I want CS to become better, I love playing it with my friends, I like the skins, and the community has brought me many laughs, but it feels like Valve is putting the bare minimum effort to keep the game alive and have people spend money. Here's why:\n\n-Game released bare-bones missing many maps and game modes from CSGO\n\n-To date, every new update makes it run worse, the latest update has issues with huge frame drops, stutters, and freezing. Frame in CSGO was consistent 400, now I'm lucky to get 160fps with half decent frame times.\n\n-Community servers are a shambling corpse of what it was in CSGO. That side of the community is dead. All the servers are full of bots. No good AWP only servers, a few good 1v1 servers, no zombies, no deathrun or the other dozens of other fun game mode servers. That whole creative side of the community has been abandoned by Valve and given little support. Surf zoomer are eating well, at least. \n\n-Maps are pretty BUT the amount of visual clutter only lowers frames and makes it harder to see enemies.\n\n-Ruined factory new skins by giving them all wear. Now a factory new skin looks like a minimal wear or even field tested from CSGO. Example, Bizon Osiris. (thanks for making those skins slightly cheaper, at least)\n\n-Player models are not accurate to hit boxes, the default CT is terrible. I've flicked to parts of the model that don't count as a hit. That is a terrible decision for a competitive game.\n\n-No more default player models that vary depending on the map. Not a big loss, but it shows a lack of attention imo.\n\n-The HUD keeps getting worse. It's amazing how badly they can mess this up. CSGO had a minimalist, clean, and easy to read HUD with all the important info in places that have a physical reference point irl, like the health at the bottom left. New CS2 HUD has transparency on everything, selected items don't highlight as well, I really miss the nice touch of my weapons being highlighted in the color of their rarity, mini map is harder to read, my money is bigger than my health or armor, and I don't need to know what team I am by having a big emblem in the middle of my screen. The HUD is provably and quantifiably worse than in CSGO.\n\n-Why do we have first shot inaccuracy?? Why? Makes zero sense in this type of competitive game. Why do I need to miss my one-tap headshot when my aim is on the enemy's head? Is the game really better for having that?\n\n-Hacker issue still not fix, and the hacks have only gotten more powerful. We are talking Rainbow Six Siege levels of absurd hacks. They can change the spread of shotguns and change the the fire rate, absurd things like that.\n\n-Ranks and elo systems are terrible and matchmaking will put you in games that will force you to lose. I'm talking about putting you against teams with 5k more elo than anyone on your team.\n\n-Still no overwatch system like in CSGO.\n\n-The biggest updates we got until now is a few community maps and the ability to switch hand view model... SIX months in. You know the community is starving for content when that is considered a huge update. In CSGO that would be a normal bi-monthly update.\n\n-Hit reg is terrible and it's probably sub-tick being terrible. \n\n-AWP nerfs were not needed and makes it frustrating to use. Inaccuracy when getting hit is terrible and taking longer for the scope to settle after aiming makes getting quick kills a game of luck at times. The AWP was fine in CSGO, maybe even perfect and satisfying to use, CS2 doesn't feel the same. I can't say it's worse, but It doesn't feel like CS anymore.\n\n-Run and gun meta has only gotten worse.\n\n-the tracers lie and your spray control would do better without it.\n\n-Casual is now even worse to play because of terrible frame rate and frame timing.\n\n-Game is trying way too hard to \"modernize\" and feel like the other zoomer competitive games like Valorant. Know what you are and own it. I don't want a cluttered HUD or an mvp animations, and please never add keychains.\n\n+ Grenade line up reticent is an great change.\n+Most skins look amazing\n+maps are nice look great, even if they run terrible.\n+Follow recoil is kinda cool, works wonder on the Negev.\n~Da Dust2 box",

    "review": "I\u2019ve been a fan of the Counter-Strike series for years, but Counter-Strike 2 has left me underwhelmed. The biggest issue is the lack of significant new content. The remastered maps look prettier, but that\u2019s about it. No new maps to speak of, which is a major letdown. The community is divided on the new subtick system, and I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s an improvement. It\u2019s too complicated and feels like a gimmick.\n\nThe removal of features from CS:GO is also a blow. The buy wheel was a simple, intuitive system that\u2019s been replaced with a grid that\u2019s busier and more confusing. And don\u2019t even get me started on the VAC system, which seems to be ineffective against cheaters. The rank system is also broken, with inconsistent progression and frustrating setbacks.\n\nA Step Backwards\n\nCounter-Strike 2 feels like a step back from its predecessor. The graphics are nice, but the gameplay has taken a hit. The game\u2019s difficulty is off the charts, making it hard for new players to get on board. Even experienced players like myself are struggling to adjust. The lack of innovation and the removal of beloved features make it hard to recommend Counter-Strike 2 over CS:GO.\n\nFree, But Not Worth It\n\nThe game\u2019s free upgrade is nice, but it\u2019s not enough to make up for the lack of substance. MW2019, another tactical shooter, is a better option in my opinion. Counter-Strike 2\u2019s poor design choices and lack of new content make it a disappointing experience. Until Valve addresses these issues and adds meaningful updates, I\u2019ll be sticking with CS:GO or exploring other options.",

Visibility and FPS performance has decreased with no real benefit. Why they even spent time doing this makes no sense when the majority of players are on stretched resolutions and/or use playing configs . People want fun over realism. \r\n\r\nAudio is horrible. You are now forced to use their new \"binaural\" processing nonsense that they introduced as a new audio setting late into CSGO's lifecycle. Standing on stairs on Mirage, I cannot hear someone shooting a USP from cat without maxing the volume. Why?\r\n\r\nMain menu is convoluted and confusing. You can't leave a comp match without the game forcing you to sit through a 2-3 second fade transition instead of just loading the menu. More useless nonsense. Also, the community browser has been broken since the release of CS2; it still doesn't work. \r\n\r\nCheating at all levels of competitive is still an issue.

Because of this, not only are cheaters not getting banned, but completely innocent people are instead. Not to mention the fact that the higher levels of Premier are more or less just cheaters in some fashion. This is genuinely one of the most egregious wrongdoings in all of multiplayer gaming for this being such a popular franchise, and Valve gets away with it because of the legacy of CS.\n- Higher fidelity graphics, which comes as a double-edged sword because a large portion of the community played GO because of it's non-taxing graphics, making it easy to run, and now that community has been completely left out to dry\n- Barely any new content, just bug fixes and that's pretty much it. Remember the game is no longer in beta!\n- The ranking system in this game is so incredibly bad that third parties have to use their own system, and that system is considered to be more reliable and well respected than the official one. Think of another game that has to do all of this. I can't. Not to mention the fact that these third parties have a more reliable anti-cheat than the game itself.\n- As minor as this may be, there are no longer any achievements except one, and that's for launching the game...\n- When CS2 was announced, one of the biggest points of excitement was for 128 tick servers. Plenty of other games have this (VAL being the primary example because of it's similarities to CS), and the decision to use sub-tick was such a cop out, sleazy was of fixing the problem, and no one actually thinks sub-tick is a better solution than 128 tick. There is so much money being poured into this game, you cannot say that Valve does not have the means to maintain servers that would provide an objectively better experience for the end user.\n\nThis game is fun extremely casually, but don't bother putting an extended amount of time into it, because clearly Valve would rather not put time into it either.",

The new maps are shiny and modern, but you\u2019ll still find yourself getting lost in them because your sense of direction is as bad as ever. And yes, that corner where you keep getting sniped from?

    "review": "The game devs have said many times this is not a souls-like, I corrected people many times to tell them it is not a souls-like. Turns out that yeah, I think it is very much a souls-like. \n\nRight off I think this is going to create a problem for a lot of buyers who likely were expecting an \"action RPG\" as while it certainly does have some of those characteristics, make no mistake, this is a very difficult game at times. \n\nThe combat is definitely souls inspired though it is quite unique in some ways, as there is effectively no base blocking mechanic but rather you basically build up energy to unleash heavier attacks and you can do so via dodging perfectly or many basic hits on an enemy (to put it simply). At first as a souls enjoyer I struggled to understand what they were expecting and the combat initially felt clumsy and not at all tight. \n\nBut once you lock in and start learning how to perfectly dodge, there is nothing more satisfying than pulling off multiple perfect dodges back to back, with a very satisfying audio and visual effect to indicate you did pull off a perfect dodge. But it took me hours of dying to the first 'boss' (Wandering Wight) to finally realise the combat is fast, punishing but immensely satisfying and I think that is being overlooked with all the drama surrounding the game. \n\nThat being said, I would have loved a ranged option to deal with the very annoying archers that appear regularly and for a monkey man, he seems to have a distinct lack of climbing ability which seems a bit odd\n\nOn that note, we all probably know the premise of the story and it is presented beautifully, if slightly confusing if you are unfamiliar with the source material. The Chinese mythological setting of the game is not something I have played in often if at all, so it makes for an interesting and original setting for me and the fact it is absolutely beautiful and atmospheric is just icing on the cake here. They have created some full AAA quality cutscenes to move along telling the story and they feel not unlike the grand cutscenes in God of War in scope and quality, they really have done a great job here in my opinion. \n\nThe world is absolutely beautiful with a very distinct Unreal 5 look to it, though it is very linear with some limited exploration to be had but you will often find an invisible wall stopping you from venturing off the trail and they maybe could have been a bit more creative with how they keep you in the limits of the map without just straight up invisible walls but for me this is just a minor complaint. \n\nSound is great and of course the graphics are stunning, though of course with the caveat that this is an Unreal 5 game and it uses all the latest visual fluff, so don't think you're going to max this out on your GTX 1050 and have good time. But it scales well and if you follow guides like the Hardware Unboxed optimisation guide you should be able to get it running well on very modest hardware. \n\nIn summary I think this is one game that surprisingly lived up to the hype, while it isn't perfect I think overall these guys have done an amazing job for their first big release and it could very well end up being one of the top games of this year. \n\nI think a big thing to understand as a potential buyer going into this game, is that it is VERY difficult at times and this I am sure is going to catch a lot of people out as an unpleasant surprise.",

It isn't \"perfect in every way\"; but what it does well, it does better than most before it and resets several bars in terms of expectations for games going forward.  Its graphics, its fluidity in movement; its animations; its level design; its bosses...all top-notch.  \n\nIt is absolutely NOT a souls-like.  It has a few elements of what makes soulslikes great; but leaves out the frustrating parts. It acknowledges that it is already a tough game and doesn't further burden the player with the tedious punishments that some of us souls-like-fatigued have become accustomed to tolerating:\n\n- No hunting down souls dropped\n- No min/maxing builds based on a subset of weapon types\n- fewer punishing second-phase fights\n\nMay seem like a short list, but the lack of that \"Holy crap, I hate this game...I can't believe I just grinded through this entire level for the past hour only to get one-shotted and lost all my progress\" feeling.\n\nAs many other players have noted, this game is far closer to GOW.  \nMy favorite description I read so far was:\n\n \"It's like God Of War, Ghost of Tsushima, and Elden Ring had a threesome and nobody knows who the father is.\"\n\nCons (short list):\n\n- invisible walls are especially noticeable in the first chapter.  Annoying to see something that looks like a cave, but hit an invisible wall five feet in front of it.\n- A noticeable halo effect caused by what appears to be post-processing setting. Toning that down made a good improvement.\n- some heavy granular effects by what I assume is some graphics setting in either post-processing.\n- Not sure if the \"FSR\" is FSR3...also, we can't completely turn off the FSR/DLSS apparently...it looks like we can only set it to quality and up the resolution limit to 100%.  It would be nice to be able to turn it off; even if it is only for a comparison.  \n\n\nBut aside from those very minor nitpicks, this game is an all-time-top-tier-absolutely fabulous game and I HOPE MAJOR GAME STUDIOS WILL SEE HOW SUCCESSFUL THIS IS AND FOLLOW THEIR LEAD!!!\n\nMore of this type of game: Complete; functional on launch; great writing; great characters; outstanding graphics and gameplay...NO MICROTRANSACTIONS...\n\nBuy it.

The world and visuals are stunning, although exploration is linear I want to see everything this game has to offer. This is also the first game where I chose not to play in default english, as it sounds so much better in original voice (chinese) and it makes for a more unique experience.\n\nCombat is souls inspired, but difficulty is very forgiving. There is no block/parry button, you only have to dodge attacks at the right time. Also at dying you won't loose anything, but enemies will respawn on dying and resting. This game is not hard as souls-like so noob casuals like me can give this a try. However it can still be challenging and some bosses will make you die over and over again. You can't rush in and mash buttons expecting not to die in a few hits. With that said you may have to adapt your skill points, thankfully respec doesn't cost anything so you have all the freedom to try out different abilities/playstyle.\n\nTo summarize, it's an amazing singleplayer game with all the right components- interesting story, great gameplay, amazing visuals and sound effects. Optimization is very good. I can play it on my old pc (i5-7500 and GTX 1060) with a bit of tweaking. Great purchase, fantastic game! 10/10",

    "review": "Yes I'm aware that my thumbs up is never going to be seen by anyone. There is literally thousands of them. \n\nBut what I'm NOT seeing is people actually talking about the game. At least at time of writing. Most people are talking about how good it looks, or how well it plays. Or vice versa. But no one talking about what the game is like. Or how it feels to play it. Is it worth my fricken money???\n\nWell let me help with that. Yes it's worth the money.\n\nIt's a souls-like game despite it not having that tag on the steam store page. It plays similar to Jedi Fallen Order or God of War or Darksiders. It's a linear action game where if you die you go back to a resting point. If you rest at said resting point all enemies respawn as does your healing items. However unlike Dark Souls or Elden Ring you don't lose experience points, money or items when you die.\n\nBut yes, the production value in this game is off the charts. It looks even more beautiful then it does on the steam store page. It sounds beautiful too. The gameplay is also fun, fluid and engaging. There's so much done right about this game that I hate to talk about whats wrong with it.\n\nFor instance the tutorial is severely lacking. Barely teaches you anything. \n\nOr how there's little to no direction in the game. Unless i'm severely missing something. But After the first hour I was absolutely, completely. 100 percent lost. No idea where to go or what to do. The game is lacking in direction in pretty much every single definition of the word and I actually hate that.\n\nBut if you can find your own way, don't mind really hard games and don't mind a character with no character or a plot with no plot then this game does everything else 110 percent perfect.\n\nSo let that be your deciding factor I guess. I mean 60 dollars is still a lot of money, just know what you're getting into. But if this genre is what you're looking for then it's worth the money.\n\nIf you'd like a more in-depth look at the game and what not feel free to check out my review on my YouTube Channel (link below).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd7FjFAk6Rg\n\nOtherwise, thanks so much for reading and I hope I managed to help some of you out there spend your money wisely.",

BUT it has never intends to be yet it is still good enough to make your moeny worth spending. You dont need to be well aware of any Chinese old customs or traditional stories to play this game. Chinese people didn't stop playing Greek story game for lacking the background knowleage. The game speak for himself(or herself). And if you are really concerned about the political right kinda stuff apear in this game, it might disappoint you. It doesn't have black or white people,or lgbtq+ people, but for the very least, there ARE wolves and elephant and dogs and frog people in it so consider is DIVERSIFIED enough.

I'd much rather have a linear experience in beautifully crafted environments, which this game has. Honestly, there's much exploring to do, and it's always worthwhile.\r\n\r\n[b] No map! [/b]\r\nI would never have expected this to be an actual complaint. This game gives me flashbacks to the late '90s and early 2000s, where you actually play a game and don't get directions spoon-fed. You have to use your eyes and recognize where you've been and where you can still go. It's what makes exploration fun and worthwhile. Backtracking through areas to see if you missed anything.\r\n\r\n[b] It's an endless boss rush, kill a few mobs and the next boss is in sight [/b]\r\nAgain\u2014How is this a negative? The boss fights are the reason we play this genre of games. I'm amazed at how much love and attention has been put into each boss. They all have gorgeous visuals and fun, engaging movesets.\r\n\r\n[b] No diversity and inclusion! [/b]\r\nI find diversity, equality, and inclusion important topics. However, not every game needs it. Some games have a good place and fit for it, like Baldur's Gate 3, which does it very well. However, this is a mythological game where you play as a monkey and beat up rats, lizards, and the like.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the few games in the last few years where I'm having a blast playing. It feels like a mix between God of War and Monster Hunter in a Souls-like sauce. The game is hard enough to be challenging but easy enough to craft your own build without googling for strong and effective builds.",

And lots of research to do on Journey to the West and Chinese mythology.\n\nCombat is speedy and dynamic but quite precise and usually pretty clean / readable but sometimes turns messy because of weird camera movements and even weirder hitboxes. \n\nA somewhat uneven localisation (at least in English)  and a frustrating amount of invisible walls.

    "review": "Black Myth: Wukong is a game I've eagerly anticipated for what feels like an eternity, and it doesn't disappoint. This title perfectly captures the essence of a classic hack and slash experience, evoking memories of the golden PS3 era. The gameplay is smooth, satisfying, and relentless, offering the kind of visceral combat that fans of the genre will instantly fall in love with.\n\nWhat makes Black Myth: Wukong stand out even more is its scale. The game doesn't just pit you against a handful of enemies; it throws you into epic, sprawling battles that feel monumental. The sense of grandeur in each fight, the vast environments, and the formidable foes all contribute to a game that feels as massive as the legend it\u2019s based on.\n\nSpeaking of legends, the story is rooted in the already incredible tale of the Monkey King, one of the most beloved characters in Chinese folklore. The narrative pulls you in, blending myth with a dark, fantastical world that is both enchanting and terrifying. Black Myth: Wukong doesn't just tell the story; it makes you live it, putting you in the shoes or rather, the fur of one of the most iconic characters in mythology.\n\nHowever, it's frustrating to see the double standards in the industry when it comes to discussing diversity and inclusion in video games. Screen Rant, for example, has been criticized for targeting only Asian games with accusations of lacking diversity titles like Stellar Blade, Genshin Impact, and now Black Myth: Wukong.\n\nAnd honestly, what kind of diversity are people expecting from a game about a stone monkey fighting demons? There are literally no humans in sight, not even Chinese characters, because the story is rooted in myth, not in modern social narratives. Yet somehow, some still find things to complain about, pushing Western agendas into places they simply don't belong.\n\nEdit: Wow the game reached 2.2 Million player, becoming one of the most played single player game ever. This is the result of making game for the sake of making game, instead of making a game for political agenda.",

    "review": "(Review in progress, 8h so far, 2 chapters completed)\n\nThis game surprised me more than I expected. The level of polish and care put into it is quite impressive and I absolutely loved my time with it so far. Graphics and art-design are top notch, sound design is great, music has its highs and lows, but what it doesn't lack is identity, it's pretty original. If you're familiar with the original story or Chinese mythology, you'll probably love the interpretations of characters from there, if you have no idea what is it about, prepare yourself for a wild ride, it can get quite weird, but equally amazing. \n\nNow, the main thing - gameplay. Overall I can say that it's pretty fun and I had a good time with it, especially thanks to the very decent enemy variety and non-stop bosses with their own quirks, but the only gripe that I personally have with the game - is the lack of combos, or just overall depth of core staff combat. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, however it seems like the combat's variety is leaning more towards a couple of special abilities and you waiting for them to be available again, while with the staff itself you have only one light attack combo and with that only 3 variations of heavy attacks, plus you can't cancel out of many of your animations, which is annoying in a game like this. Also most of your character progression is tied to stats improvements. I guess after playing many games like DMC series, Bayonettas, even something like recent GOW, Darksiders etc, I got spoiled with even more responsive and flexible combat systems, but other than that, I'm more than satisfied with everything else.\n\nCan I recommend it? Heck yeah! We need more single-player games like this one.\nWho is it for? I'd say it's a mix of a Souls-like meets GOW, but it has its own unique ideas as well.\nFinal score (as of now) - 8.5/10 \nIf the game manages to surprise me with something else, I'll be glad to raise the score to at least 9/10, but I'm a bit picky about some gameplay details. Still impressed though.\n\nUPD after 30 hours and almost finishing the game - I'll leave the score at 8.5 and my main points still stand. This game is impressive and it's one of the best and most solid 8/8.5 out of 10 sorta games you'll ever play, but some parts of the game outstay their welcome and combat doesn't evolve much (some people have a different opinion on this, and that's fine by me).

Very fun to play, linear and semi-open world regions with lots of exploration, secrets, enemies and some remarkable bosses.\n\nAs far as performance goes, if you don't use Ray Tracing on Very High (or don't use it at all) and turn on upscaling, you'll be fine. Ray Tracing is quite demanding in some areas later in the game. Even with Frame Generation, it may not be enough depending on your GPU. \n\nAlso, yes, New Game+ unlocks after you finish the game. You get to keep everything you earned, except the items required to progress the story. Enemies also become stronger.\n\nSpecs:\nRyzen 5 7600\nRTX 4070\n2x16GB 5200MHz DDR5\nSSD Nvme Gen4\nWin 11\n\nPlayed most of the game at 1440p, 60 fps, Cinematic Settings, DLSS Balanced, FG ON, Ray Tracing Very High.\n\nDuring the last chapter I had to tune down Ray Tracing a bit to maintain an average of 60 fps. \n\nI had one crash. No blue screen or out of memory errors.",

Of course, for friends from non-Asian cultural circles who want to understand the story of this game, they must be familiar with relevant literary works (Journey to the West). The localization of this game is also a challenge. As Chinese people, we are easy in understanding the dialogue and lines in the game, because the story of Journey to the West is well known to women and children, but for English players, some lines with a large number of religious, mythological and ancient Chinese (classical Chinese) elements will bring no small understanding challenges.\n\n\u53f2\u8bd7\u7ea7\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u4e1c\u65b9\u4f20\u5947\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5236\u4f5c\u7cbe\u826f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u8868\u6f14\u6548\u679c\u548c\u4e00\u6d41\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u548c\u97f3\u6548\u3002\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cc\u7a0b\u7891\u3002\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u4e9a\u6d32\u6587\u5316\u5708\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u60f3\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u719f\u6089\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6587\u5b66\u4f5c\u54c1\uff08\u300a\u897f\u6e38\u8bb0\u300b\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e5f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u96be\u7406\u89e3\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u53f0\u8bcd\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u300a\u897f\u6e38\u8bb0\u300b\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u5bf9\u5987\u5973\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u4f17\u6240\u5468\u77e5\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u82f1\u56fd\u73a9\u5bb6\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u5e26\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u5b97\u6559\u3001\u795e\u8bdd\u548c\u4e2d\u56fd\u53e4\u4ee3\uff08\u6587\u8a00\u6587\uff09\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u53f0\u8bcd\u5c06\u5e26\u6765\u4e0d\u5c0f\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u6311\u6218\u3002\n\nLet's talk about some flaws in the current game:\n1) There is no scene map, and for players who are not accustomed to exploring and wandering maps, finding their way may pose some challenges.\n2) The game does not have difficulty adjustment options, and some bosses are very challenging.\n3) The skills of the BOSS unit are not clearly indicated, making evasion difficult.\n4) There is no way to pause during cutscenes, or it is difficult for non Chinese users to read lines (subtitles are too small), and there is no way to view \"historical dialogue records\".\n\n\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u6765\u8c08\u8c08\u5f53\u524d\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\n1\uff09 \u6ca1\u6709\u573a\u666f\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u4e60\u60ef\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u6f2b\u6e38\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8def\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002\n2\uff09 \u6e38\u620f\u6ca1\u6709\u96be\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u6709\u4e9bBOSS\u975e\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\n3\uff09 BOSS\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u95ea\u907f\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\u3002\n4\uff09 \u8fc7\u573a\u52a8\u753b\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u505c\u987f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u975e\u4e2d\u6587\u7528\u6237\u5f88\u96be\u9605\u8bfb\u53f0\u8bcd\uff08\u5b57\u5e55\u592a\u5c0f\uff09\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u67e5\u770b\u201c\u5386\u53f2\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5f55\u201d\u3002",

    "review": "[h1]Black Myth Wukong Review [/h1]\nI played 9 hours but 4 were offline so I think it will say I played 5 hours, I didn't beat the game, yet I still made this comprehensive review to explain the core aspects of the game and it's quality. This review uses my own experience and those of my friends who got ahead in the game. I am 30 years old, and I don't enjoy souls likes anymore in the long term. Still, I did my review objectively and I think you might find it useful. Cheers!~\n\nBlack Myth Wukong is a soul-like game that adds some interesting elements to the genre by incorporating new ideas into its gameplay through the legendary tale of Sun Wukong. Players can transform into bosses they defeated before (with some limitations), and Wukong's tricks are plenty. They can range from transforming into rock to making multiple clones of themselves or freezing foes in place, unable to move or fight back.\n\nThe player will explore the tale of the legendary monkey king while fighting challenging bosses and recovering the artifacts of Wukong. The game starts easy but rapidly reaches difficulty levels of your most popular soul games, requiring skill, strategy, and wits to defeat fearsome foes. \n\n[h1]What Makes It Worth Playing?[/h1]\nIf there is something people hear about this game, it is two things: transforming into bosses and ray tracing. The ray tracing of the game looks beautiful, as reflections and environments look superb on the screen. The requirements are quite bulky, as I used an RTX 4070 Super and could either go 2k with Ray Tracing at medium with settings on very high for 70-90 FPS or 4k with no ray tracing at the same frame rate.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3313363373\n\nThe story is surprisingly very good and interesting, voice actors do well in their assigned roles, and the opening of the game is similar to a blockbuster movie. The tale deals with wanting to be free, which Wukong wants, but the Celestial Court won't let him be. In addition, the court enjoys mocking him and other beast-like creatures, angering him as he rebels to prove his might. The difficulty is another aspect that might attract players looking to establish themselves and face off against challenging foes in exciting and nerve-wracking gameplay.\n\n\n\n[h1]Core Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game's core combat focuses on options and the availability of resources. The player has multiple avenues for choosing how to fight enemies, such as spirits that they can summon and take their form to unleash special attacks, becoming bosses, using skills such as invisibility, or using their pole to get above the enemy and avoid attacks. Having so many assets to use on foes and see what works best against certain enemies is incredibly fun and rewarding.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3313362079\n\nThe premise is that the game is a boss rush; you go to a place, explore it, beat the boss, and move on. If you defeat bosses effortlessly, you run into a lot of bosses on the norm, and each combat is intriguing and unique. Battle monks that summon the fallen, rat siblings in a 1vs2, giant tigers that bathe in the blood of their foes with big swords, etc. The game action is fast, so you have to act quickly before enemies resume the onslaught of attacks. There is no co-op for this game (so those that like souls games with co-op experiences, be warned, it is only going to be you!), and there is no punishment for dying in-game, so you are stress-free and don't have to pick up your \"souls\" or currencies of other types.\n\n\n[h1]My Experience[/h1]\nI enjoyed my time in the game, as brief as it was (I am getting old to be playing this hardcore game, I swear, haha~). I didn't find the stances attractive, as the default stance worked better for me than the other two. The tricks of Wukong are fun to use, and in boss fights, you need to use all of your arsenals intelligently to emerge victorious on the challenging boss fights, which is a great gameplay design. Enemies often have their particular bag of tricks they will use on the player.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3313363052\n\nI used many points in the foundation, mainly HP and stamina. I also used some points in transformations and the immobility spell, as they are instrumental. The gameplay is like a combination of souls, like in action games. It is hard, but you are as powerful as your foes, making the soul-like experience less stressful and difficult. The game's presentation is fantastic; enemies react to your boss's transformations, and the dialogue in fights is on par with the rest of the game. \n\n[h1]Long Term Appeal [/h1]\nA game playthrough will last between 40-60 hours, depending on your skill, and you can always replay the game after beating it to challenge even stronger foes. I am getting burned out of the genre. Go there, fight a powerful enemy, get destroyed, do it again until you succeed, and repeat for another 40 hours. I may have been playing too much Elden Ring, but I don't enjoy Souls games as much as I did before.\n\nBack to the review, if you like challenges meant to block your progression and prove your skills, this game is impressive. It excels at all its facets and is incredible to experience. If you prefer to avoid difficulty, be wary. It is a marathon to get to the end of this title, as the mountain is rather tall and complex to climb.\n\n[h1] Price Point Analysis[/h1]\nIt is an easy buy for its asking price. If your computer can run it, you are guaranteed to have a good time with this game.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIn a genre so cluttered with so many games that it feels oversaturated, Black Myth Wukong succeeds in adding a new spice to the genre by revolutionizing the gameplay and rewards of its core experience. It is a must-play for all souls, like fans who enjoy this title, and an invitation to try it out for those who feel braver and confident in their skills. This game's graphics, music, story, gameplay, and design are superb and worth all the praise it's been getting.\n\n10/10 MASTERPIECE\n\n\n:) If you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator!

    "review": "Black Myth Wukong is an absolute masterclass of a game. All the hype, all the praise, all the positive buzz surrounding this game...they're absolutely deserved and this is hands down, one of THE best games of this generation, not just this year. The combat, fluidity of animations, the level and boss design, the intricate level and environmental design, all the different characters and enemies, they're all very unique, varied and superbly crafted. When you take control of the Monkey King (Sun Wukong) you really feel the power behind that staff and every swing you make against your enemies. I won't spoil the details but the gameplay mechanic is very rich and varied and rewarding. There's a whole level up system that can be used to power up your abilities and spells which can be used in subsequent battles. This btw is not necessarily a souls-like game even though some mechanics are present there but the combat style is very fast and responsive. I'm only just scratching the surface of the game and trust me when I say, this is one of the best action RPG games I've ever played in a good while and easily among to very best the game industry has to offer. \n\nEasily a 10/10 for me. Well done Game Science for creating such a well-crafted masterpiece. You deserve all the success and praise.",

    "review": "After 20 something hours in the game I think I finally have a better grasp on what the games about now. If you want the TLDR of it then I'd say the game is worth picking up, whilst the game certainly has its quirks, it also has really solid gameplay, amazing graphics and a surprisingly compelling story-line for those willing to look deeper into the game. I'd say those reasons make the game worth trying if nothing else.\n\nFor those interested in hearing me ramble for a bit, I'd say that this game really wasn't anything that I expected it to be, someone likened it to Chinese God of War, and I\u2019ll admit I can understand why, the levelling system and limited weapons options are very reminiscent of God of War 2018 with attacks and movies being very weighty and full of depth. Personally, I initially thought of game like lies of p with its linear map design and story chapters but the longer I\u2019ve played this the more I\u2019ve realised that Black myth Wukong is a game that subverts expectations.\n\nIn the beginning I was somewhat disappointed in the lack of challenge that enemies presented, I thought that the enemies died too quickly and that you had way too much stamina to really strategize with your moves, so combat felt button mashy with no real depth since \u201c you could easily dodge everything, like,  it wasn\u2019t as if you\u2019d run of stamina anyway\u201d and this made the otherwise cool levelling system useless since I already felt overpowered. Then I encountered wandering wight (the second mini boss) and realised that you needed to have that much stamina otherwise you can\u2019t even participate in the battles much less win.\n\nThen I felt that the game just had too many boss battles, so much so that with how linear the game was it felt like it was a boss rush game with very little to explore or lore to encounter, just boss battle then cutscene a then further boss battles, but this couldn\u2019t be further from the case. While the game has a strong focus on boss battles, it also has many storylines, quests, even hidden lore, cutscenes and entirely new maps to explore for anyone interested in looking. The thing is though, the game is more than happy to have you miss these huge bits of content, the lack of an in-game map and the many invisible walls also make it a little challenging to notice initially but when you do you realise there is a lot more to the game than initially seems with content far more engaging than you\u2019d have thought.\n\nThe game subverts these expectations over and over until you start wondering if the flaw you notice in the game is really a flaw or if it's something that's been addressed and you just haven\u2019t gotten far enough or looked deeply enough for it to be resolved. This is the reason that I thought I had to play for a bit before I could comment on it and after so many hours, I think I get finally get it. \n\nI can honestly recommend this as a game worth trying and many only real complaints with it are the often-obnoxious invisible walls and the lack of a player hub of some sort that's unanimously safe. that and the sharpening feature on fsr that makes the images look so much worse. but overall game of the year\n",

    "review": "After beating the game twice and seeing both endings, I can finally give it my personal assessment. This review contains spoilers and a considerable amount of bias, so take it with a grain of salt.\n\n[h3]Graphic / Art Direction[/h3]\nIt's an easy 9, or even 10, for me. With a triple-A budget pair with UE5, the graphical fidelity is impressive. While some have pointed out that stock assets are used to paint the environment, I honestly don't mind that much as long as they blend in well. Chapters 1 to 3 probably have the most distinguished biomes and stunning architecture. IIRC, the team 3D mapped a bunch of historical buildings and reconstructed them in-game. This approach is a breath of fresh air after playing Western AAA games for so many years. The animated mini-series from each chapter is also surprisingly well-made and unexpected; it gives the game a such unique character in terms of art direction.\n\n[h3]Plot / Storytelling[/h3]\nFor those who have never read the classic Journey to the West, the plot might seem puzzling and confusing. I don't blame you; the narrative is scattered all over the place, and each chapter could be its own standalone story. For those who actually read the classic novel, the plot is just as baffling as everyone else. In fact, the world setting is only partially based on the original work. Black Myth's team has taken creative liberties to reinterpret Journey to the West based on another modern novel named \"Wu Kong\" and their previous Journey to the West MMO. The tone is much darker, the writing is edgier, and the underlying message is up to you to interpret. I only hope they can come up with a more coherent plot that stitches all the chapters together.\n\n[h3]Combat / Gameplay[/h3]\nFor this section, I might need to break it into two parts: the Monkey itself and the rest of the mobs. The destined one has a very limited move set. Some weapons have their own variants added to the basic attack, but that's about all you get. The combat mechanic is relatively shallow and gets repetitive fast. There are some builds that synergize certain spirits with your gears, but the variety is still lackluster. \n\nOn the contrary, I much prefer the enemy diversity. Although some re-skins exist, most still have their own move set and animation. There are a total of 55 mini-bosses and 26 bosses, which brings the total to 81. This odd number may not be apparent to some, but in the JttW novel, this is the exact number of tribulations they must endure to retrieve the scriptures. Interestingly, 81 is also the number of achievements on the PC end. I'm absolutely fond of the last fight with WuKong, with Erlang coming in a close second. Everyone and their mother has watched the 86 JttW TV series in China, and the amount of love and homage they put into the final battle is off the charts. This battle alone carries the entire Chapter 6, considering how bland the level design is otherwise. I couldn't think of a better boss fight in recent years. Yes, as I said before, I'm incredibly biased on this; the nostalgia hits differently.\n\n[h3]Overall[/h3]\nIn its current state, I give it an 8.5. It is an excellent entry as their first AAA title. Although it has its flaws, a good game doesn't necessarily excel in every single aspect. The storytelling could be better because it doesn't complement how great the art direction is. At the same time, if they intend to create a semi-boss rush ARPG, I hope they can iron out the invisible walls in both level design and during combat, along with more in-depth combat mechanics to ensure both elements complement each other.\n\n\n\n",

I would like to say more about the game's narrative in which so little people are discussing.\n\nThe story is a very good twist to the Wukong narrative which has the protagonist journey through different places to gather the 6 relics of The Great Sage (Sun Wukong) to bring him back from the dead. \n\nEach Chapter feels like a philosophical Buddhist dialogue about characters that have failed to follow in the steps of Buddha due to their earthly nature. There are beautiful movie shorts that play at the end of each chapter that adds a layer of narrative to the characters and the places you visit. Best way to describe it is like if Elden Ring showed you a movie before everything went to shit. Theres also a mural with an old wise man narrator making philosophical commentary on the tragic characters that you meet (and fight) during your journey which is a really nice touch. There is some humour to be found that these characters are in stark contrast to Wukong's effortless attainment of Buddhahood in which he later regretted due to having missed the simple joys of life. This fuels the thematic conflict that is pervasive in this game; Man's desire to transcend the Earth and escape the tragedy of this world, as opposed to giving in to Earthly desires and all the things, both good and bad, attached to it. \n\nThis is a very tonally consistent game with a very subtle, introspective emotional delivery (similar to Elden Ring). Music is used at a minimum here, with it only really playing during boss fights. Despite music not being used often, it is effective when it is (especially in Chapter 2). It is so unlike western games that are more overt with its delivery of narrative mood. Games like God of War 2016 uses music more heavily and changes mood according to the scene being showed. It also easy to tell when scenes in God of War are trying to be humorous due to me knowing the language. In Wukong, it is very hard to tell the humour apart due to me not knowing Chinese language and culture. I can tell people will have a different experience of this game whether if you're from China or not but this is just how the game made me feel.\n\nI played the game in English VA to really get the emotional aspect that the narrative is trying to deliver. Whether it is true to the Chinese vibe, i do not know. \n\nAll in all, it is a very fun game. 9/10 \n\n",

I am currently stuck at this boss since their AI just turns off midfight and I refuse to fight a target dummy. \n\nIt runs pretty well and combat looks pretty good so far but bosses, which seems to be the main focus of the game, doesn't work properly.\n\nEdit: After like five tries the boss AI worked and I finished the fight. But later on unsurprisingly out of 6 bosses or so 2 of them also stopped fighting midfight and 1 of them refused to die. I tried that boss again 3 more times to no avail. I literally cannot continue the game. Some people have no problems like I do but I also saw enough to know this isn't just happening to me. If you want to gamble go ahead but be warned. Wait for a patch for sure.\n\nUPDATE: Found a solution. So if your Windows language is not EN or CN and if your alphabet contains the letters \"\u00f6,\u00fc,\u011f,\u015f\" (I don't know which one of these letters cause the problem. Can be one can be all of them at once) the boss AI just gives up for some reason. So the solution is to change your windows language to EN.

I went in with no expectations or hype whatsoever, and frankly I don't get it.\n\nThe game has terrible level design, you are bound to hit an invisible wall (even if the place you are trying to reach is part of the level, sometimes there's just an invisible wall to prevent you from going there from a specific angle for some reasons) no matter where you go, the paths are also not intuitive, I was actually going around the level trying to find what I had missed only to find out that there was a small gap to crawl in to progress hidden inside a cave, there was nothing to tell me this was there, I found it by pure chance, the combination of the invisible walls, non-intuitive levels and the lack of a map to find those paths on makes exploring very frustrating.\n\nThe combat feels wrong, sometimes you do an input mid-roll and the character does the move related to that input right after the roll, and sometimes he does not, heavy attacks have ridiculous delay to them which makes them feel terrible to use. In some fights, you could start a heavy attack before the boss starts his attack and get punished anyway. You barely do any damage to bosses and kill regular enemies way too easily, which makes the bosses the only actual challenge, well except for actually finding them, unfortunately the bosses have terrible arena designs and sometimes attack fast enough to get you with a follow-up attack right after your dodge. \n\nThe story relies way too much on the base material, if you have not read the book, none of it makes sense.\n\nThe game does look pretty, but if its not fun then why would I play it.",

It feels like you have constant input lag. When you land a heavy attack it doesn't feel rewarding because of the randomness (sometimes you get interrupted, sometimes you don't).\n\nThe level design is very strange, in a bad way. You get tired of trying to reach places and explore because of the inconsistent and invisible walls. \n\nThe bosses doesn't feel significant or interesting since you stumble upon new ones constantly. No build-up or back story to get the excitement up before the next boss.\n\nI'm not even going to get started on ranged enemies.\n\nNo FOV adjustment. Extreme over-sharpening of the graphics with no ability to turn it off RUINS the beauty. Camera movement is incorrectly implemented and extremely annoying.

While I found many positive reviews, I also came across several criticisms and complaints that made me reconsider. \r\n\r\nMy advise is 'Don\u2019t let negativity sway you' and here\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t be deterred with these comments:\r\n\r\n-Trailers look too good to be true: Sometimes trailers can seem misleading, but this game truly lives up to the hype.\r\n\r\n-It doesn\u2019t look like a Souls game: Some people argue that if it\u2019s not a Souls game, it won\u2019t be enjoyable. However, while Souls games aren\u2019t for everyone, this one offers its own fun, challenge, and rewards.\r\n\r\n-It looks like a Souls game: Others might complain about another Souls-like game. While it\u2019s challenging, it\u2019s more forgiving compared to other Souls games that can be punishingly difficult.\r\n\r\n-It might be too short (15 hours of gameplay): While some may worry about the length, the game actually offers much more content than anticipated.\r\n\r\n-It\u2019s not an open-world game: Though it\u2019s not an open-world game, it\u2019s also not overly linear. There\u2019s plenty of exploration and hidden areas to discover.\r\n\r\n-It\u2019s a boss rush game: While it features many bosses, it\u2019s also packed with smaller enemies and challenges that keep the gameplay exciting.\r\n\r\nIt seems some critics are quick to judge without giving the game a fair chance. If you\u2019re on the fence, I assure you it\u2019s worth it, especially if you\u2019ve enjoyed the Sun Wukong character from TV series. Playing as him brings a wonderful sense of nostalgia and excitement.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this game is a fantastic experience and definitely worth your time!",

The game emphasizes dodging, and then rewards you with really bizarre hitboxes because the enemies have invisible walls around their body which means you can't be underneath them, which mean your attacks constantly whiff, and bosses can hop a metre away and completely avoid your heavy attacks, which are your win condition.\n\nBanging your head against Consort Radahn was frustrating, but fun still because you could feel your progress and know you failed because you messed up.

At least it had very little frame drops most of the time on a XTX7900 and an AMD 7800X3D.\n\nGameplay: Basically this is a boss rush game. Nothing more, nothing less. Combat is pretty to look at, basically stays the same for the whole game. Maybe that is why people hype it so much because it is fun at the start but gets boring real quick. Around 95% of the bosses are one shot pushovers which you will have forgotten about 5 minutes after killing them. The other 5% are just frustrating to fight because they were so badly designed especially the later game fights where every boss has at least 2 health bars as well as transition phases that make then immune to you but they will still attack you which go on for far too long. Also mechanics wise they have a lot of very similar moves e.g. basically every later game boss has a move that puts them above your head and makes them shoot a multitude of projectiles at you. Just very repetitive all around.\nAlso game would have really benefited from some sort of map.\n\nStory: Know Journey to the west or don't bother trying to understand who the characters in the game are or what you are doing besides \"get all the monkey king relics\".\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention the absolutely terrible skill tree.

    "review": "This is the first title where I actually, genuinely feel deceived by the few reviews I watched. \"It's not inspired by the soulsbornes, it's their own thing\" was uniformly propagated. Well guess what - it's another soulsborne game with some minor twists to the formula I will get into.\n\nI deliberately bought this game to finally get some reprieve from the excessive influence Fromsoft has had on the last decade of games and it's just more of the same. The challenge lies entirely in the game obfuscating what to do.  Normal enemies are a minor nuisance, bosses are the focal point. Bosses perform devastating attacks that you need to internalize - and without having seen them performed prior you either get away with a crude, unrewarding feeling victory, or you need to repeat the same thing a few times over. I've stated before I don't like this concept. I don't like games that feel they don't need to communicate their intent. I already played all Souls games there are. I did not buy into this thinking it was just more of the same.\n\nThe combat model itself is, I suppose, a play on the existing model. Rather than stance breaking a la Sekiro, you generate Focus points by attacking (or charging). Focus points can be leveraged in a multitude of ways that allow you to take some initiative and deal big damage. You don't feel anywhere near as helpless as your average souls game - you intermittently decide the pace of the fight. \n\nI won't judge the quality of the twist, nor the admittedly great visuals - for I am wholly put off by being deceived into thinking this wasn't another soulsborne purchasing it.

    "review": "Black Myth: Wukong is not the game that you think it is. The opening is strong, with gorgeous visuals, incredible art direction and mystifying enemy and boss design. The problems begin however when the introduction is over and the real game begins. Black Myth Wukong dresses itself as an RPG but this is only superficial. In reality, Black Myth Wukong is a Boss Rush. There's very little downtime between boss fights, often moving directly from one fight into another. When there is something in-between, the game offers only linear levels with nothing in the way of exploration.\n\nThat's not to say that the game isn't entirely without merit. Visually the game is a feast for the eyes, and the music and sound design are top quality. The combat system is as visually pleasing as it is mechanically deep, there's an array of skills, spells, transformations, items and equipment at the players disposal.\n\nHowever, this variety is hampered by the totally linear progression, armour and weapons are not found in the game world, they are unlocked in the shop after an arbitrary amount of progress has been made. Likewise for spells and skills which are only unlocked after specific points of the story. This leaves the game severely lacking in player agency, there's no decision making in where to go or in what order you progress the story, each \"level\" of the game is a beautifully decorated corridor with a boss waiting for you at the end and even within a scant few hours, the shallow game-play loop becomes immediately apparent. \n\nThe boss rush nature of the game falls flat without the framing behind it. Bosses that have fantastic visual design have no framing within the story, there's little to no lore or explanation behind the enemies you're facing and it can leave you erratically jumping from one quirky boss fight to another with a feeling of disconnect. Without this framing, the significance of the boss is lost and what could have been a grandiose fight becomes a pedestrian affair, each boss becomes just another box to tick on your road to the end of the game.\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong is a spectacle, for sure, but it feels like it's using that spectacle as a crutch to distract from how little depth there to the gameplay, it feels like all of the mechanics of a good RPG were created, they just forgot to create the world to go with it.",

It seems like the developers just expect everyone to have read the story and understand whats going on.\n\nNext sin the combat. First i'd like to say that the actual combat feels great, nothing groundbreaking but fun. My biggest issue is the amount of bosses and the miniscual amount of damage you do to them. In the first chapter you fight 5 or 6 bosses, most of them happen one right after another. Even when i upgraded my weapons I tickled most of the bosses i fought while they took out a quarter of my health with one hit. This game obviously takes inspiration from god of war and jedi survivors however the one thing they didn't incorporate from those games is a difficulty option. If they wanted to make it more of a souls like game, they should've allowed for greater weapon customization to compensate for the minuscule amount of damage your base weapon does. Instead they give you a stick and expect you to just keep bonking the bosses until they stop moving. While I do acknowledge this can be fun for some people, I found it infuriating. Another big issue with some of the fights is the camera, at the end of chapter 1 you fight a random bear dude who loves to dash from one end of the arena to the other. While on paper this sounds fun, in execution the camera constantly jumping everywhere makes it hard to read the bosses movements and dodge accordingly. Another aspect of the combat that infuriates me is the skills. While yes the skills your given are really cool, they aren't as big of a help as you would think. Take for instance the freeze skill. Every time i used it, it was a guessing game for how long it would last. Sometimes it would last for 10 seconds and other times it would last for a single second, there were even times it didn't work period. The skills also use your \"mana\" however you are given no way of recovering your mana other than using rest points. So once your mana runs out, these skills which are vital to the gameplay are no longer available to you and you're back to using your stick which does no damage. \n\nThe last sin I want to talk about is level design. While yes the maps are GORGEOUS and exploration is highly encouraged, the problem lies in the absurd amount of invisible walls throughout some of the maps. Every time i saw what looked like a path i could explore i was stopped by an invisible wall. Exploring parts of the map i was allowed to explore also wasn't that rewarding, I often found myself walking in circles because the path you were supposed to follow wasn't made clear and most of the \"rewards\" you find are either in game currency or another boss which rewards you with a lackluster skill.\n\nOverall if you're that desperate for a god of war/jedi survivor type game go ahead and play this. But be warned this game isn't as polished as those games are. If you want to experience the journey to the west story DO NOT play this game, nothing is explained and you'll probably just end up as confused as i am.",

    "review": "Dont let the people saying \"Chinese Bots spamming Reviews\" discourage you from giving this game a try. If 96% of 200,000 reviews isnt enough to get you to try the game a few more things to look forward to are as follows-\n\nCombat-\nDeceptively simple at first, seeming like a crap ton of light attack spam until you start to look into the different skill trees. Truly one of the most densely packed combat systems I have ever seen. While Im sure you might be able to play the entire game light attack spamming and spam rolling there is a giant amount of room for you to express some skill. With about 76 (a random large number) different parry systems and combos you will quickly realize that there is PLENTY of different ways to take on this game.\nEnvironment/Looks-\nI truly dont understand how people can say the game doesnt look gorgeous, not to mention the level design in general is amazing. Its not just \"dressed up straight lines\" as another person declared its truly dynamic and beautiful. Each chapter of the game showing off something completely different its impossible to get bored of the look, not to mention stopping several times to just admire the game.\nPerformance-\nNow obviously with such a gorgeous game on UE5 its going to be difficult to run thats sort of a given. That being said its no where near impossible a specific review I saw claimed they were on a 4080 SUPER and could hardly run it. Well with my drivers all up to date and everything properly taken care of, on the MAX settings with ray tracing AND an ultrawide (3440;1440) I ran the game above 100 fps almost ALWAYS and rarely could tell if upscaling was needing to do anything at all. Ive heard bad things about AMD obviously I cant speak on that, but a friend of mine owns a 1660 SUPER and was still capable of playing the benchmark (which has been completely accurate for me in testing) at 70 fps on medium ray tracing off.\nStory-\nAgain something that is admittedly subjective, and I LOVE the chinese mythos as well as the story of wukong in general. The way they present every fight, the cinematics at the end of each chapter, and how they bring it all together is just beyond words. Not to mention the sheer amount of extra lore you can read or find in alternate areas is something that I just cannot describe as anything other than amazing. Now obviously the lip syncing does not match at all with the English dub, from what I can tell and have been told the game was dubbed in Mandarin, so I mean yeah obviously it wont be the same, but the voice acting itself is top notch.\nPrice-\nSixty dollars is obviously a lot of money but hey at least its not seventy like most games these days, I think its absolutely worth the price I wont miss a single dollar. But waiting for a sale if you cannot afford it is never a bad thing.\nMonke-\nMonke\nSoulsLike-\nThe developers have been stressing to every reviewer and everybody in general that this is not meant to be a souls-like. There are some obvious similarities with the checkpoint system and the roll focused combat and the challenging bosses. But I would agree that if I had to draw a similarity, its more closely related to God of War or something of that nature. Rarely does it feel like im playing a souls-like. \nConclusion-\nThe game is AMAZING, and my general rule for this kind of thing is to NOT listen to reviewers hell, I have never reviewed a game before I just loved this game so much. But for the love of god if the reviewer has less than 2 hours played and the product is refunded and they claim to know all about the story being boring and the combat being awful the level design being trash without even PLAYING 5% OF THE GAME. Just play it for yourself, and you can form your own opinion.",

Some more challenging than others, but all are unique and memorable for you to tackle again on your next playthrough in NG+. Everything in this game works well together; the spirts, spells, vessels\u2026all of them made for some really cool variety in gameplay. The ability to change your build on the fly is a huge plus and I loved the chapter-to-chapter format of the story. Animated cutscene story tales were an awesome touch to bring each chapter to a close. Most of all, I loved finding all the hidden areas and questlines along the way, figuring out secret items and bosses that you might not run into without exploring. All of the achievements were fun to go after, collecting all items and defeating every enemy to complete your journal is an awesome feeling to accomplish. This game deserves all the positive feedback it\u2019s receiving and I hope to see DLC/a sequel in the future! \r\n\r\nAchievement Count: 81\r\nTime to 100%: ~70hrs\r\nDifficulty: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\r\nGenre of Game: Action RPG, Mythology, Combat\r\nFun Rating: 9/10\r\n\r\nCheckout my YT video review or my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/twigmastergaming] Steam Curator Page!

Huge open maps that feel procedurally generated they're so bland.  The game is positively littered with invisible walls which makes exploring a tedious mess.  Running down a path only to find that THIS one ends in an invisible wall while THAT one allows you to continue walking is shockingly awful.\n\nLevels are massive open spaces with a tiny smattering of enemies.  The game feels like a boss rush.  The camera is terrible, the bosses range from fine to terribly designed. The gear progression is completely pointless, the story is non existent, encounter design is comical.\n\nThe devs might have said the game isn't a souls-like but it very obviously is.  Sadly it's a bad souls-like.  It's not even in the same universe of the best games in the genre.  Obviously it's hilariously bad compared to From games but it's also massively inferior to the Deck 13 games, the Remnant games, the Team Ninja games and most of the good 2D souls-like games.\n\nThe game swings wildly from so comically easy the game is boring to annoyingly designed difficulty where you spend 60 percent of a fight literally running after a boss or running away as a boss floats in the air.\n\nThe game looks nice.

    "review": "Game is still buggy. Interface is not optimized. To use a spell / item you need to pull up a menu to cast. Often times there is a delay when pulling up the \"menu\" to casting the spell / item. Results in a clunky experience. \n\nTerrain is also a major hindrance to any fight since it is only an obstacle for you, not for the enemies. The enemies attacks can go right through any terrain as if it wasn't there. For example the White Noble fight, his slashes can clear through any terrain regardless if it is passable or not. There are a few other fights as well where the terrain will straight up block you, yet not the boss during the animation of the attack. Still clunky, would suggest waiting for a more optimized experience\n\nAdding onto this review after a bit more gameplay: The menu mechanic is so buggy. When you try and use the \"legendary item\" the menu will pull up, but if you're in the middle of an animation, it won't cast, just pull up, so then you're sitting there like okay cool? meanwhile a boss is chain stunning you to oblivion. So apparently the only way you can use those items is to pause, stop, don't do anything, pull up the menu, select the item, cast the item, and pray to sweet baby jesus that the boss hasn't hit you buy then. The entire casting process takes roughly 2 second or so, but in a game like this, not moving, not dodging, and being a sitting duck for 2 full full seconds is enough for you to go from 100% health to 0% health, especially with boss chain stuns (example yellow sage with his wind, swipe, kick, spear).",

    "review": "I think normally I might give this game a \"recommend\", but I think, in the face of the overwhelmingly-one-sided positive reviews, I'll mark this \"not recommend\" just so people will actually be able to find some critiques that I haven't seen much.\n\nFirst off, this game reminds me a lot of two Team Ninja games \"Wo Long\" and \"Nioh 2\", leaning more towards the former than the latter in terms of execution. If you've played either of these, you will quickly feel like Wukong is a subpar imitation. The reason is that a lot of special Yaoguai powers literally don't feel like they have any use and they're really clunky to pull off consistently. Additionally, the combat is very repetitive, as the stances available only change your heavy attack and not light attacks. The most obvious outcome is that you end up sticking to just a few skills the entire way through, because other options aren't viable, while also doing the same light attack / heavy attack combo without variation. It gets boring really fast.\n\nOn top of that, the basic enemies provide no challenge at all, while the bosses provide a varied amount. I think this sets up a weird expectation, as normally you'd have the basic enemies to ramp you into boss fights, but instead your first real boss fight (either the Wandering Wight or fire-blade Yaoguai) will come as a surprise in terms of damage numbers and such, particularly the Wight, which seems designed to be beaten until after you've collected a few different special powers, levels, and armour.\n\nI don't think difficulty is bad, but other games that Wukong has taken inspiration from do a much better job at ramping players into their first challenge. I also found that, weirdly, as the game progressed, the bosses got easier to deal with. I had the most difficulties with the Black Flame King, mainly because of his tendency to completely ignore the paralyze spell and do a lot of damage with quick moves that aren't telegraphed well.\n\nI also see a lot of people praising the graphics, but I genuinely think there's a fundamental lack of style and attempts to set enemies apart from the environment. The colours in the first two chapters match the basic enemies so well that they often just blend into the background in a lot of areas, and on top of that, I just personally don't think the attempt at realistic visuals works well. It kind of just looks like an unreal engine graphics demo, and the over-reliance heavy particle simulations for the elemental effects really doesn't help in that regard, not to mention hurting performance.\n\nI think games like Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and Nioh work well not because they are visually-realistic games, but because the graphical style is readable. The end result of Wukong's style is that, because of the way effects are done, the telegraphed moves are hard to figure out by watching them and instead you have to learn the timings through being punished for getting them wrong. There are also just sometimes really wonky hitboxes, which don't help.\n\nAlso, some dark areas are crazy dark, with the light simulations of torches in the environment usually doing nothing to illuminate the enemies often encountered in such areas. It honestly feels less like a design-choice and more like an engine limitation. Paritcularly given the fact that turning up gamma all the way changes nothing.\n\nThe story is another part that I think a lot of people will be frustrated with. I think it's cool that they are using Journey to the West as the fundament for the game, but it's clear that there's a lot of context you won't have if you are playing this as non-native Chinese. There aren't any attempts to try to fill these gaps in context and after my first 5 hours I just started skipping through as much dialogue as I could, because I had no idea what the hell was going on, lol. That being said, the Chinese voice-acting is great, I recommend switching it on with subtitles, since the English dub really has a lot of VAs hamming it in.\n\nI think I might be more negative towards this game than normal, since it was so majorly hyped and I'm a big souls-like fan. Having recently beaten my second playthrough of the new Elden Ring DLC probably also didn't help. But yeah, I don't think this game is worth the hype. As a souls-like fan, I'd give it maybe a 6/10 in its current state, due to the many problems stated above. I just think it's kind of boring after only 10 hours into it. The boss designs are cool, but the execution isn't good enough.",

    "review": "This may be the first time playing a steam game that I have ever felt an overwhelming need to post a negative review.  It is a shame that the current state of the game includes a major design flaw that ruins an otherwise stellar experience.  It is one that is [b]so bad that I find it hard to press on playing after almost a week of play[/b].\nIn the interest of fairness to the parts of the Wukong development team that actually did a great job, the following aspects of the game are deserving of its currently [i]Overwhelmingly Positive[/i] review status:\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Enemy Design\n[*] Combat \n[*] Sound/Music\n[*] Stability/Optimization\n[*] Voice Acting (English)\n[/list]\n\nHowever, the one team that absolutely did not live up to the level of quality that their peers delivered is the Level Design team.  \n[list]\n[*] [b]Not because the levels do not look good[/b] -- [i]the environments look stunning.[/i]  \n[*] [b]Not because there is no map or map overlay[/b] -- [i]I have played other similar games with no map (e.g. Lies of P) where the lack of a map did not bother me.[/i]\n[*] [b]Not because of the cryptic steps required to unlock secret areas[/b] -- [i]Elden Ring did the same thing and while I did not like it, it was not a deal breaker[/i]\n[/list]\nThe killing blow to the experience for this game is the [b]Boundary Design[/b].  This game should have never been released with this level of lazy implementation of Player Boundary Design.  It is utterly inexcusable to price your game at the AAA level when it is clear that there was less effort put into player boundary design and QA testing than a Nintendo 64 release.\nNavigating through levels in this game feels like [b]walking through a 10'x10' glass corridor[/b] where you never know if you are going to smash your face on the the glass a few feet where a wall or drop in elevation appears to be or if said change in elevation is actually a path of progression.  \n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Inconsistency between level visuals and level boundaries\n[*] Boss arenas often contain player boundaries which do not also affect the boss\n[*] Boss arena boundaries sometimes seem to be a fraction of what the arena appears to be\n[/list]\nThe ever-present level of inconsistency with visual indicators of game boundaries and the actual enforced game boundaries makes level navigation and exploration tedious at best.  I do not find it fun to brush up against or jump at everything that looks like a boundary in order to determine if it actually is.  This lack of visual consistency is a big letdown as many of the secret paths contain very useful rewards but the sheer tedium of brute-force invisible wall testing is exhausting to the point where I no longer want to play.  \n\nThe final insult thrust upon me by the Level Design team was in the 3rd chapter where . . . [spoiler] after you fight a certain boss on a mountain path there is a shiny item on a nearby ledge.  After more than 30 minutes of trying to find a path to that area I discovered that you need to fall off of the edge of a nearby cliff to find a lower path, which I found immensely insulting as the game spent the last 40 hours teaching me that cliff edges = invisible walls.  But now I am supposed to ignore all of that and just try it because . . . you know what, it doesn't matter because I am not playing your game anymore.[/spoiler] \n\n\nIf this ever gets fixed I will change my review, and if on the infinitely unlikely chance that the Wukong Game Director reads this review -- allow me to pose a hypothetical question for you:  \n[hr][/hr]\n\"If you went to a 5 Star Steakhouse and ordered their most expensive steak.  You receive the meal and it looks and smells wonderful but you find that you can not cut off a piece from the side.  The Chef tells you that the outer 1/3 of the steak is inedible but you can cut from the middle.  You take a cut from the middle and it tastes well above your expectations.  The second cut from the middle also tastes just as good if not better, but on your 3rd bite you taste nothing at all.  The Chef then explains that 1/3 of the inner portion is inadvertently devoid of taste\"\n[hr][/hr]\nWhat kind of review would you leave for that Restaurant?",

I'm relying on my cool-downs to rinse and repeat every single time and after a few too many encounters I can feel the repetitive nature scratching away at my brain.\r\nI really wanted to like this game as it IS beautiful the illustrations, the effort in the descriptions of the Yaoguai is insane.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is me being picky... but the very obvious invisible walls seems a tad lazy for the quality we see in many areas. I feel like this is an example of \"Being a mile wide but an inch deep\" when it comes to their level design. UE5 is beautiful but it isn't a crutch.\r\nI know it's not an open world game but I'd like some creativity when it comes to blocking my path.\r\n\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Storytelling\r\n- Stunning illustrations\r\n- Unintrusive UI (for how many mechanics are at play)\r\nCons:\r\n- Flat feeling combat\r\n- Early repetitive nature",

    "review": "So far I'm liking the game, but the amount of invisible walls preventing me from further exploring the world is annoying, it completely breaks the immersion and takes me out of the experience.\n\nGame Science, please have more confidence in Your Game Design and allow players to fully explore the maps, even if there's not a single item or enemy, putting invisible walls in all places, specially those set pieces that look like alternative explorable paths is a terrible idea, it takes players out of the game and discourages exploration.\n\nAll You had to do was allow players to explore small areas of those places regardless of the lack of content and the experience would have been much better.\n\nI've come across so many invisible walls by Chapter One and Two that I'm no longer exploring every nook and cranny of the game world.\n\nGameplay wise, the game is good. You're a Monke, You Bonk mystical beings with your staff, and avoid paying taxes, pretty monke-like if I do say so myself.\n\nEDIT: The game has major performance issues from Chapter 2 on-wards and needs to be optimized.\n\nApart from the performance issues; I've found that despite the crazy amount of invisible walls, this game does reward keen exploration, a lot of content is easily missable or hidden from players, but if You manage to find the right path You will be rewarded with secret content that is not accessible otherwise.\n\nI really like that, rewarding players for engaging with the game and looking out for Key Items or clues is amazing, and the boss fights that come with that content are pretty good too!\n\nCombat wise, I feel like this game has an identity crisis, because it doesn't know if it wants to be a Souls-like or a game like God of War. Combos are few and quite limited, each stance has one main combo and that's it, Thrust Stance has 2 Combos and that makes it the best stance in the game.\n\nYou're going to be using the same combos thought your whole playthrough. I honestly feel like they should have added way more moves, or make it like in Yakuza, where the MC has different fighting styles that completely change his moveset, at first the Staff Stances seem to be pointing out on that direction, but no. They just add a few moves, and don't change the Light Attack Combos.\n\nStamina management should not be in the game, period. It just detracts from the experience all together making the game unnecessarily annoying to play sometimes, and Mana should be replenished over-time or by defeating enemies in my opinion because it runs out so quickly.\n\nLike I said, BMW doesn't know if it wants to be a full-blown out Action game or a Souls-Like, and it ends up being a weird mesh between the genres. \n\nFor example, You have an Estus Flask, You got Bonfires, You have Stamina management, You have to commit to attacks because You cannot cancel them, Enemies and bosses deal an absurd amount of damage. Those are Souls-Like elements.\n\nBut You also have Generous Over-the-top moves that give You breathing time, such as the Freeze Ability, the Pillar Stance charge attack, the transformations, the Thrust Stance Light>Heavy>Heavy Combo and else.\n\nI just feel like the Developers felt pressured to make this game a Souls-Like because they weren't feeling confident in their ability to make their own thing. But this game should have been 100% an Action Game with a Gameplay more akin to God of War or Yakuza.\n\nLast but not least, there's not that many Transformations which is very disappointing. Apparently there's only 5? I thought that the idea was to be able to transform in most of the main bosses, but no. The game only gives You the ability to transform into 'certain' enemies.\n\nAnd no, Spirits don't count as Transformations because You don't get to play as the Spirit. They function more as optional abilities that recharge. Taking damage while using Spirit Abilities also sucks, I thought they made You invincible for the attack duration but no, You will get hit when using Spirit abilities which is just a bad idea since the animations are way to long and sluggish.\n\nTDLR: I wish the game leaned more into being a Fun Action game, the Souls-Like elements really hurt the overall experience and enjoyment that I'm getting from the game, and some of the mechanics or systems are either too under develop, or underwhelming at best. Primerely the Staff Stances not having their OWN Light Attack Movesets like in Yakuza, the lack of more Transformations, the way everything stun locks You or staggers You, Spirits being in the game feels like an after-thought, as if they were initially transformations that got turned into abilities for lack of development time.",

I haven't touched DOTA 2 since around 2017.\r\n\r\nWhat kept me away mostly was the duration of the matches. Some even went for more than 50 minutes and this for me was just not a viable option.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried now Turbo Mode, everything changed. This mode allows you to have faster games even to League and it packs all the good stuff and fun in it. It's a rush mode, but in itself, the games does not feel rushed. It might at first, because you will see your leveling up and building items, but slowly you will adapt to the pacing and see that it does not make a huge change in terms of pacing.\r\n\r\nOther than that, DOTA has some of the best mechanics out there and in my opinion, they are way superior than League's, simply because of the amount of extra actions you can do as a player throughout the match.\r\nComplexity does bring a little barrier though, because even if I have not seen as much toxicity, what I can say that people are not so friendly to new players. But with enough patience, you can ignore them (the reporting system is also very good, every report I made for toxic players, brought actions towards them and the game confirms it for you when) and there is also a new player mode.\r\n\r\nThe game has a fairly good tutorial system and a new player mode, which could help with that. The tutorial is pretty long and it's full of short scenarios that teach the mechanics in-game. It is really good compared to other MOBA's, which simply lack this at all.\r\n\r\nThe monetization system is also much more player-friendly than other games, such as League.\r\nThere is the aspect of loot-boxes, but the game does not limit you to use the community market to buy skins for prices as low as 0.04 per an entire skin set. Most of them are around an euro/two, but still, nothing even close to the 10/20 euro skins in League.\r\nAs far as I know, every new skin released can be traded one year after it was implemented to the game, so if you wanna save some money, you can simply wait and buy the previous released skins for a much cheaper price.\r\n\r\nYou can also try the Arcade, which is basically custom maps with custom mechanics. Personally, i LOVE to play Tower Defence modes and the Arcade mode has a few of them.\r\n\r\nUltimately, DOTA is a beautiful game, complex in its own way and will guarantee you fun if you approach it in that way. So give it a try and see for yourself.",

    "review": "EXPOSING THE TRUTH OF THIS GAME: Dota 2 has a \"you win some, you lose some\" algorithm. If you're an average or bad player, you might not ever notice. The developers know that if someone wins all the time, they'll get bored and quit. Same goes for bad players who lose all the time. So the matchmaking algorithm is rigged to put 10 players together 5v5 based on their statistics and data. So if you have won some in a row, or more wins than loses, you will find yourself thinking... wow this match sucks... its like its rigged. Yeah. That's because it is rigged. And can you exit the game? NOPE. You're chained to the mouse and keyboard for up to 1 hour just to please this algorithm. If you quit, you'll be given a penalty. IF you get a lot of penalties, and or reports, you will be put in a HIDDEN SHADOWBAN matchmaking pool. This is where they put half the cheaters and a lot of the toxic players. \"A taste of your own medicine\" type. Lovely rule to match the \"you win some, you lose some\" rule. But the problem is, even if you aren't toxic, or don't cheat, if you have high reports from being too good or from getting MVP for the match or general reports out of jealous if you understand the basic dota game, you will be put in the hidden pool anyway because th algorithm thinks you're either a cheater or toxic. But don't worry, even if you never get put in this hidden pool, you'll still meet these players in the normal matchmaking because of course Valve does not ban cheaters. If they did, they'd lose, what, 20 to 50 percent of customers and profits? Why ban them and lose money when you can just pretend and say you're making efforts to stop cheating but actually do nothing. Actually, they market cosmetic in game \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 items around the specific heros that are best used to cheat at because they are most popular of course. So yeah they don't care about the players. At all. Another reason they don't ban cheaters, is because in Dota at least, cheaters are MORE LIKELY to buy in game cosmetic items and spend cash than non cheaters. This is because MOST dota cheats cost around \u00a38 a month from forums or online site communities that sell the constantly updated mods. People for some reason use the word hack so I will for the sake of it but of course it is just game mods. Map hack, auto ability to kill last hit hero or creep, auto ability to help escape, auto ability to help attack, full vision even in fog of war (same as map hack), and other cheats. \nDota is such an iconic and classic game. And an amazing real time strategy game that looks amazing too. Unfortunately, it is COMPLETELY UNPLAYABLE.  If you're good, even good enough to power through and beat the cheating, then automatically it is assumed that you are also cheating. And you can't leave the rigged games. And you can't go AFK because it knows and gives you a penalty, And the team reports you too anyway. So you have NO CHOICE. But to be a slave chained to the screen ENDURING 4 low intelligent teammates argue and rage at each other and at you because the game is rigged and if you even try to tell them its rigged and to just stay in the base and wait for it to finish in 20 minutes instead of having to endure 1 hour+ of absolute torture, they will think you're insane. \nAnyway, if you do go ahead and install this awful game, 1. Mute all the chat settings. 2. Never ever engage in chat. Because you then give mentally ill people a live audience. DON'T EVEN TYPE 1 LETTER EVEN IF THE CHAT SEEMS FRIENDLY. It is a TRAP. 3. Don't ever try or expect to progress any type of level, or stats, kill/death ratio, win/lose ratio, commends, anything. Because its all pointless. A false promise. 4. Try to remember that the matches are rigged so you don't get annoyed! 5. Know in advance, that 90% of games, because of the messed up algorithm, mean that you either have 100% won even if you have a nap or go make a sandwich, or 100% lose, even if you are cheating yourself. SUPER EASY WIN or SUPER EASY LOSE. There's no challenge. Its automatic. But make sure you keep buying cosmetics and spending money to see the \"victory\" screen at the end of the game, 50%. of. the. time. regardless. of. anything. at. all. \nP.S. by hidden shadowban pool, i dont mean low priority pool. That's different. in 2024 I think they might have actually got rid of the shadowban pool but its no better. Plus, you now need 100 game hours to play ranked. and you will hope and pray that after 100 hours of unranked, you will be free from the toxic players and cheaters on alt accounts. Nope. They continue all the way up to high ranks. Because nobody gets banned. Because it effects revenue \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3. BUT YEAH ENJOY THIS EXPERTLY PHYSIOLOGICAL TRAP OF A GAME :D.

DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective the game is incredibly heavy in its requirements for knowledge and mechanical ability, which normally would be fine, but you will spend 99% of your time in this game with people that arent from the server region youre playing on, and they will have 0 ability to communicate with you. 100% of the players will spend the entire game pinging, feeding, trolling, being generally awful and unaware. On top of this 75% of my games consist of constant pausing because foreigners keep DCing. 80% of the games feel like absolute steamrolls one way or the other and are in an unchangable state by 20 minutes. That doesnt mean itll be a 20minute game though, it means the game will get drug out to 45-55 minutes because there is no surrender option and people would rather hold you in the prison, farming ego kills than finishing the game.\n\nA lot of players believe the game rate is 40% of the games you have no chance to win, 40% you have almost no chance to lose, 20% are close, actually playable games; how true that is, no idea, but it sure feels like its accurate.\n\nTL;DR: the game is a cesspool of no chance to communicate to try to win, people that you effectively cant play with plaguing you, and no way to actually get out of games in a timely manner.

I bought some skins too!!   My first match with players against bots, a player on the team had 82 kills!!! He killed so much so fast no one could keep up and it was quite annoying, this player with over 1000 hours in the game has sucked the fun out but whatever, it's only one match....  My second match wasn't much better so I decided to just go unranked pvp matches...every match I played I was thoroughly destroyed, camped at my spawn point, spawn, die, repeat.... every match lasts almost an hour.   When i look at my opponents they have 5k hours in this game, it's incredibly unbalanced matchmaking.  Every match I played was against people with 100's-1000's more hours than me.\nAfter watching videos on youtube and going back to playing against bots until I learn all the hero's and their abilities, I realized I would need to invest a hardcore amount of time to even be decent but the misery and frustration that would required to git gud just isn't worth my time.  I tried to like this game, I put in time and effort and even some cash on those skins but this game hates new players of the game/genre.  It's just not fun.",

Well cause its true.  I think (like 10% sure, been a while) it was in the late 1970s where in Japan they investigated their home grown baseball for fixing games and uncovered the entire sport industry in Japan was fixed by the Yakuza.  \n\nWell this is important to know cause I am suspicious of all e-sports.  Like it or not too many \"GOATs\".  That is a sign to me criminals are washing money.  \n\nLets be clear here.  They don't want your money.  They want to clean their money.  So they get the masses to believe in one \"super\" team, over bet on them.  So they can drop the drug cash on the guy with 1 to 100 odds.  So when he \"losses\", they can get their cut and pay the taxes, there by cleaning it.  If the government looks in to it, well its just a lot of drunk guys betting on the loser for a dream, who also happened to pay with hard cash.  Trust us.  \n\nTake my word or not, but we both know no hard proof is ever going to see the light of day.  Hell even if I am 100% on the money and there is a major conviction, it will be off statistics and he said/she said.  Hell anyone could be apart of it with out knowing.  Cause like it or not, a lot of people never ask questions.\n\nAnd I am going to leave this.  Of all the games Value has made in last 10 years, what percentage of them are chasing a fad in e-sports?

Please play against bots in your first 10 to 15 games because there can be some sweaty people out there. In all this game has a bunch of variety and is just fun.",

    "review": "Dota 2 has long been hailed as one of the most iconic entries in the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre, promising endless replayability and dynamic gameplay with its vast roster of over a hundred heroes and continuous updates. The official description paints a picture of a thriving, ever-evolving game, where each match offers a unique experience and competitive balance ensures fair play.\n\nHowever, when stacking it up against modern giants like Counter-Strike 2 (CS2), Dota 2's allure seems to wane. Once touted as the \"most-played game on Steam,\" the glory days are now in the rearview mirror. CS2 has surged ahead in player counts and popularity, stealing the spotlight and rendering Dota 2 a relic of a bygone era. And when you consider its competition with even quirky indie hits like Banana, it begs the question: Has Dota 2 lost its mojo?\n\nPerhaps one of the glaring limitations in Dota 2 is its lack of innovation in the gameplay department. For a game that prides itself on infinite possibilities, the core mechanics have remained largely unchanged over the years. Introducing a more dynamic element, such as firearms or other novel mechanics, could breathe new life into the gameplay, adding a layer of unpredictability and excitement that even long-time players might find refreshing.\n\nThe community, while dedicated, can be a daunting barrier for newcomers. Despite the availability of co-op vs. bots and hero demos, the learning curve remains steep, often leading to a frustrating experience for players dipping their toes in the MOBA waters for the first time. The skill- and behavior-based matchmaking system helps but isn\u2019t a cure-all for the toxic elements that can plague team-based games.\n\nIn summary, Dota 2 has undeniably left a significant mark in the gaming world. Yet, in today's fast-paced and ever-evolving gaming landscape, it's no longer the groundbreaker it once was. Without meaningful innovations and a more welcoming environment for new players, Dota 2 risks being left behind as just another page in the history books of gaming.",
