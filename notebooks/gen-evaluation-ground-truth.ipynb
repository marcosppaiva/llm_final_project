       "   \"At the moment, this game is a complete dumpster fire.\\n\\n- No real anti-cheat (which has been literally the most requested fix since the beginning of CS:GO [2012 btw!]). Because of this, not only are cheaters not getting banned, but completely innocent people are instead. Not to mention the fact that the higher levels of Premier are more or less just cheaters in some fashion. This is genuinely one of the most egregious wrongdoings in all of multiplayer gaming for this being such a popular franchise, and Valve gets away with it because of the legacy of CS.\\n- Higher fidelity graphics, which comes as a double-edged sword because a large portion of the community played GO because of it's non-taxing graphics, making it easy to run, and now that community has been completely left out to dry\\n- Barely any new content, just bug fixes and that's pretty much it. Remember the game is no longer in beta!\\n- The ranking system in this game is so incredibly bad that third parties have to use their own system, and that system is considered to be more reliable and well respected than the official one. Think of another game that has to do all of this. I can't. Not to mention the fact that these third parties have a more reliable anti-cheat than the game itself.\\n- As minor as this may be, there are no longer any achievements except one, and that's for launching the game...\\n- When CS2 was announced, one of the biggest points of excitement was for 128 tick servers. Plenty of other games have this (VAL being the primary example because of it's similarities to CS), and the decision to use sub-tick was such a cop out, sleazy was of fixing the problem, and no one actually thinks sub-tick is a better solution than 128 tick. There is so much money being poured into this game, you cannot say that Valve does not have the means to maintain servers that would provide an objectively better experience for the end user.\\n\\nThis game is fun extremely casually, but don't bother putting an extended amount of time into it, because clearly Valve would rather not put time into it either.\",\n",
